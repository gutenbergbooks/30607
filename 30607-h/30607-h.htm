<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>A few words by way of Preface are requisite, in
order that the objects of the present Work may be
stated to the reader, and that he may also be made
acquainted with the sources whence the information
here communicated is derived, and from consulting
which he may still further inform himself concerning
Australia. The aim of the writer of the following
pages has been,&mdash;while furnishing a description of
some of the most flourishing and interesting settlements
belonging to the British Crown, which, at
the same time, exhibit in contrast to each other the
two extremes of savage and civilised life;&mdash;to
call the attention of his countrymen, both at home
and in the colonies, to the evils which have arisen
from the absence of moral restraint and religious
instruction in colonies of civilised and (nominally)
christian men. And although it must in many ways
be a disadvantage that the person professing to describe
a particular country should have gained all his
knowledge of it from the report of others, without
ever having himself set foot upon its shores; yet, in
one respect at least, this may operate advantageously.
He is less likely to have party prejudices or private
interests to serve in his account of the land to which
he is a total stranger. In consequence, probably, of
his being an indifferent and impartial observer, not
one of our Australian colonies wears in his eye the
appearance of a perfect paradise; but then, on the
other hand, there is not one of those fine settlements
which prejudice urges him to condemn, as though
it were barren and dreary as the Great Sahara itself.
And the same circumstance&mdash;his never having
breathed the close unwholesome air of colonial
party-politics&mdash;will render it less likely that his
judgment respecting persons and disputed opinions
should be unduly biassed. There will be more probability
of his judging upon right <em>principles</em>, and
although his facts may (in some instances, unavoidably)
be less minutely accurate than an inhabitant
of the country would have given, yet they may be
less coloured and less partially stated. Instead of
giving his own observations as an eye-witness,
fraught with his own particular views, he can calmly
weigh the opposite statements of men of different
opinions, and between the two he is more likely to
arrive at the truth. With regard to the present
Work, however impartial the author has endeavoured
to be, however free he may be from colonial passions
and interests, he does not wish to deceive the reader
by professing a total freedom from all prejudice.
If this were desirable, it is impossible; it is a qualification
which no writer, or reader either, possesses.
But thus much may be stated, that all his prejudices
are in favour of those institutions with which it has
pleased God to bless his native land. In a volume
that is intended to form part of a series called &ldquo;The
Englishman&#8217;s Library,&rdquo; it may be permitted, surely,
to acknowledge a strong and influencing attachment
to the Sovereign, the Church, and the Constitution
of England.</p>

<p>The object and principles of the present volume
being thus plainly set forth, it remains only to
mention some of the sources whence the information
contained in it is derived. To the Travels of Captain
Grey on the western coast of New Holland,
and to those of Major Mitchell in the interior, the
first portion of this Work is deeply indebted, and
every person interested in the state of the natives,
or fond of perusing travels in a wild and unknown
region, may be referred to these four volumes,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
where they will find that the extracts here given
are but a specimen of the stores of amusement
and information which they contain. Captain
Sturt&#8217;s &ldquo;Expeditions&rdquo; and Mr. Oxley&#8217;s &ldquo;Journal&rdquo;
are both interesting works, but they point rather
to the progress of discovery in New Holland than to
the actual state of our local knowledge of it. Dr.
Lang&#8217;s two volumes upon New South Wales are full
of information from one who has lived there many
years, and his faults are sufficiently obvious for any
intelligent reader to guard against. Mr. Montgomery
Martin&#8217;s little book is a very useful compendium,
and those that desire to know more
particulars concerning the origin of the first English
colony in New Holland may be referred to Collins&#8217;s
account of it. Various interesting particulars respecting
the religious state of the colonies in Australia
have been derived from the correspondence in
the possession of the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts, free access to which
was allowed through the kind introduction of the
Rev. C. B. Dalton. Many other sources of information
have been consulted, among which the Reports of
the Parliamentary Committee upon Transportation,
in 1837 and 1838; and that of the Committee upon
South Australia, in 1841, must not be left unnoticed.
Neither may the work of Judge Burton
upon Religion and Education in New South Wales
be passed over in silence; for, whatever imperfections
may be found in his book,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the facts there set forth
are valuable, and, for the most part, incontrovertible,
and the principles it exhibits are excellent. From
the works just mentioned the reader may, should he
feel inclined, verify for himself the facts stated in
the ensuing pages, or pursue his inquiries further.
In the meantime, he cannot do better than join the
author of the little book which he holds in his hand,
in an humble and earnest prayer to Almighty God,
that, in this and in every other instance, whatever
may be the feebleness and imperfection of human
efforts, all things may be made to work together for
good towards promoting the glory of God, the
extension of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, and the salvation of
mankind.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The vast tract of country which it is the object of the
present volume to describe in its leading features, both
moral and natural, may be said to consist of two islands,
besides many small islets and coral reefs, which lie
scattered around the coasts of these principal divisions.
The larger island of the two, which from its size may
well deserve the appellation of a continent, is called
New Holland, or Australia; and is supposed to be not
less than three-fourths of the extent of the whole of
Europe. The smaller island, so well known by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
names of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, or Tasmania, (from those
of the discoverer, Tasman, and the Dutch governor of
Batavia, Van Diemen) is not to be compared in size to
the other, being about equal in magnitude to Ireland,
and, like that island, abounding in fine and excellent
harbours. Although, strictly speaking, the name of
Australia is confined to the former of these two islands,
yet it may be understood to include the smaller island
also; and under this name it is proposed to make the
reader familiar with the chief objects of curiosity in the
natural world, and likewise with the state of human
society, whether savage or civilised, in the two islands
of New Holland and Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, so far as both
of these have been hitherto known and explored.</p>

<p>It is by no means certain what nation may justly lay
claim to the honour of the discovery of New Holland,
the coasts of which were probably seen by the Spaniards,
Quiros or Torres, in 1606, and are by some supposed to
have been known to the Spanish and Portuguese yet
earlier than this date, but were not regularly discovered
until the Dutch, between the years 1616 and 1627, explored
a considerable portion of the northern and
western shores of that vast island, to which they gave
the name of their own country, Holland. To the
Spaniards this land was known by the names of Terra
Australis Incognita, (The Unknown Southern Land,) or
Australia del Espiritu Santo, (The Southern Land of the
Holy Spirit,) the meaning of which last name does not
exactly appear, unless it arose from the discovery of
Quiros having been made a little before Whitsuntide.
Since that time the coasts of this immense island, extending,
it is said, to no less than 8000 miles, have been
gradually explored, although they still remain in some
parts very imperfectly known. Indeed, it was only in
the year 1798 that Van Diemen&#8217;s Land was discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to be an island separated from New Holland, of which
before that time it had been thought to form a large
projection or promontory.</p>

<p>New Holland is situated in the vast ocean extending
to the south and east of the Spice Islands, and it lies
about even with the lower part of the continent of
Africa, only at an immense distance due east of it. Its
extreme points of latitude are 39 degrees and 10&#189; degrees
S., and of longitude 112 degrees and 153 degrees 40
minutes E. from Greenwich, so that it includes in its
huge extent climates both tropical and temperate, but
none that are decidedly cold. It must be remembered,
indeed, that the countries south of the equator become
colder at the same latitude than those that extend towards
the north; but, nevertheless, the nearest point
towards the South Pole, 39 degrees, nearly answering
to the situation of Naples in the northern hemisphere,
cannot be otherwise than a mild and warm climate. The
shape of New Holland is very irregular, its coast being
much broken and indented by various great bays and
smaller inlets; but it has been estimated to have a <em>width</em>
from E. to W. of 3000 miles, and a breadth from N. to S.
of 2000, containing altogether not less than three millions
of square miles. Of course, it is impossible, in so
large an extent of country, that the interior parts of it
should have been explored during the few years in which
any portion of it has been occupied by Europeans. Accordingly,
almost all the inland tracts are still a vast
blank, respecting which very little is known, and that
little is far from inviting. Indeed many hindrances
oppose themselves to the perfect discovery of these
inland regions, besides those common obstacles, to encounter
and overcome which every traveller who desires
to explore new, wild, and savage countries, must have
fully made up his mind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
First among the peculiar difficulties which have opposed
the Australian explorer is the height and ruggedness of
that chain of mountains, called, in the colony of New
South Wales, the Blue Mountains, which form a mighty
barrier of more or less elevation along most parts of the
eastern coast of New Holland, sometimes approaching as
nearly as 30 miles to the sea, and at other places falling
back to a distance of 60 or nearly 100 miles. These
mountains are not so very high, the loftiest points appearing
to exceed but little the height of Snowdon in
Wales, or Ben Nevis in Scotland; but their rugged and
barren nature, and the great width to which they frequently
extend, render it no very easy matter to cross them
at all. Indeed, although the settlement of New South
Wales was founded in 1788, it was not before 1813 that
a route was discovered across those vast ranges which
shut in the colony to the west. Frequently had the
passage over the Blue Mountains been attempted before,
but never with any success; and the farthest point which
had been reached, called Caley&#8217;s Repulse, was a spot
that almost seemed to forbid man&#8217;s footsteps to advance
beyond it. Nothing was to be seen there in every direction
but immense masses of weather-beaten sandstone-rock,
towering over each other in all the sublimity of
desolation; while a deep chasm, intersecting a lofty
ridge covered with blasted trees, seemed to cut off every
hope of farther progress. But all these difficulties have
now long since been got over, and stage-coaches are able
to run across what were a few years ago deemed impassable
hills. Yet, when this dreary barrier of barren
mountains has been crossed, another peculiar hindrance
presents itself to the exploring traveller. In many parts
of the interior of New Holland, which have been visited,
the scarcity of water is such that the most distressing
privations have been endured, and the most disagreeable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
substitutes employed. And yet, strange to say, the very
same country, which sometimes affords so few springs,
and of which the streams become dried up into chains
of dirty pools, and at last into dry ravines and valleys, is,
occasionally, subject to extreme floods from the overflowing
of its rivers, and then offers a new obstacle to
the traveller&#8217;s progress in the shape of extensive and
impassable marshes! To these difficulties must be
added the usual trials of adventurous explorers, the
dangers and perplexities of a journey through pathless
forests, the want of game of any kind in the barren
sandstone districts, the perils sometimes threatened by
a visit from the native inhabitants, and, altogether, we
shall have reason rather to feel surprise at what has
been done in the way of inland discovery in New Holland,
than to wonder that so much remains yet undone.</p>

<p>In consequence of the interior portions of the country
remaining still unknown, fancy has been busy in forming
notions respecting them, and one favourite supposition
has been that there exists somewhere in the
central part of New Holland an immense lake or inland
sea; but of this no proof whatever can be produced, so
that it can only be said that <em>it may be so</em>. Certainly,
unless some such means of communication by water, or
some very large navigable river, should exist, it is hardly
possible to imagine how the extensive tracts of inland
country can ever become civilized or inhabited by
Europeans. And of that portion which has been visited
a considerable extent of country appears to be shut out
by the natural barrenness of its soil and sandstone-rocks
from any prospect of ever supplying food to the colonies
of civilized man. So that, while the whole of New
Holland is an interesting country from its natural peculiarities,
and even the desolate portion of it adds, by its
very desolation, a deep interest to the adventures of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
those persons who have had the courage to attempt to
explore it; yet the chief prospects of Australia&#8217;s future
importance seem to be confined to its line of coast,&mdash;no
narrow limits in an island so extensive. Hence the
colonies now flourishing on the eastern, southern, and
western shores of New Holland, especially on the first,
will form a chief object of attention in the present work;
although, as will be seen by its contents, the &ldquo;bush,&rdquo; or
wild country, and its savage inhabitants, will be by no
means overlooked.</p>

<p>Respecting Van Diemen&#8217;s Land much need not be
here said, although, however small in comparative extent,
its population was in 1836 above half of that of
the whole colony of New South Wales. It is, therefore,
and always will be, an important island, though, from its
mountainous character and confined limits, it cannot, of
course, be expected to keep pace with the increasing
population of the sister colony. Van Diemen&#8217;s Land
was discovered in 1642, by the Dutchman, Tasman, who
first sailed round its southern point, and ascertained
that the great Southern Land, or Australia, did not
extend, as it had been supposed, to the South Pole. The
island was apparently overlooked, until, in 1804, a colony
was founded there by the English, and it was taken possession
of in the name of his Britannic majesty. Since
that time, with the exception of those early hardships to
which all colonies seem liable, it has been flourishing and
increasing. To many Englishmen its colder climate,
(which is yet sufficiently mild,) and its supposed resemblance
in appearance and productions to their native
land, have appeared preferable to all the advantages
which the larger island possesses. Van Diemen&#8217;s Land
is divided from New Holland on the north by Bass&#8217;s
Straits, its extreme points of latitude are 41&deg; 20', and
43&deg; 40' S., and of longitude 144&deg; 40', and 148&deg; 20' E. Its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
shape is irregular, being much broken by various inlets,
but its greatest extent from N. to S. is reckoned to be
about 210 miles, and from E. to W. 150 miles, containing
a surface of about 24,000 square miles. The native
inhabitants of this smaller island have entirely disappeared
before the superior weapons and powers of
<em>civilised</em> man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE BUSH, ON OR NEAR THE COAST.</strong></p>


<p>All that country, which remains in a state of nature
uncultivated and uninclosed, is known among the inhabitants
of the Australian colonies by the expressive
name of <em>the Bush</em>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It includes land and scenery of
every description, and, likewise, no small variety of
climate, as may be supposed from the great extent of
the island of New Holland. Accordingly, without indulging
in surmises concerning the yet unknown parts,
it may be safely said, respecting those which have been
more or less frequently visited and accurately explored,
that the extremes of rural beauty and savage wildness
of scenery,&mdash;smiling plains and barren deserts, snowy
mountains and marshy fens, crowded forests and bare
rocks, green pastures and sandy flats,&mdash;every possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
variety, in short, of country and of aspect may be found
in that boundless region which is all included under the
general appellation of <em>the Bush</em>. To enter into a particular
or regular description of this is clearly no less impossible
than it would be tedious and unprofitable. And
yet there are many descriptions of different portions of
it given by eye-witnesses, many circumstances and
natural curiosities belonging to it, and related to us
upon the best authority, which are likely to please and
interest the reader, who can see and adore God everywhere,
and is capable of taking delight in tracing out
and following the footsteps of Almighty Wisdom and
Power, even in the wilderness and among the mountain-tops.
It is proposed, therefore, to select a few of the
pictures which have been drawn by the bold explorers
of the Bush, so as to give a general idea of the character,
the scenery, the dangers, and the privations of that
portion of the Australian islands. And, having first
become familiar and acquainted with these, we shall be
better able to set a just value, when we turn to the state
of the colonies and their inhabitants, upon that moral
courage, that British perseverance and daring, which
have, within the memory of man, changed so many
square miles of bush into fertile and enclosed farms;
which have raised a regular supply of food for many
thousands of human beings out of what, sixty years ago,
was, comparatively speaking, a silent and uninhabited
waste. When the troops and convicts, who formed the
first colony in New South Wales, landed at Port Jackson,
the inlet on which the town of Sydney is now situated,
&ldquo;Every man stepped from the boat literally into a wood.
Parties of people were everywhere heard and seen
variously employed; some in clearing ground for the
different encampments; others in pitching tents, or
bringing up such stores as were more immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wanted; and the spot, which had so lately been the abode
of silence and tranquillity, was now changed to that of
noise, clamour, and confusion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>And still, even near to the capital town of the colony,
there are portions of wild country left pretty much in
their natural and original state. Of one of these spots, in
the direction of Petersham, the following lively description
from the pen of a gentleman only recently arrived
in the colony, may be acceptable. &ldquo;To the right lies
a large and open glen, covered with cattle and enclosed
with <em>bush</em>, (so we call the forest,) consisting of brushwood
and gigantic trees; and, above the trees, the broad
sea of Botany Bay, and the two headlands, Solander and
Banks, with a white stone church and steeple, St. Peter&#8217;s
New Town, conveying an assurance that there are Englishmen
of the right sort not far from us. And now we
plunge into the thicket, with scarcely a track to guide
our steps. I have by this time made acquaintance with
the principal giants of the grove. Some are standing,
some are felled; the unmolested monarchs stand full
200 feet high, and heave their white and spectral limbs
in all directions; the fallen monsters, crushed with their
overthrow, startle you with their strange appearances;
whilst underfoot a wild variety of new plants arrest your
attention. The bush-shrubs are exquisitely beautiful.
Anon a charred and blackened trunk stops your path:
if you are in spirits, you jump over all; if you are
coming home serious, weary, and warm, you plod your
way round. Well,&mdash;in twenty minutes&#8217; time you reach
a solitary hut,&mdash;the first stage of the walk: you pass the
fence, the path becomes narrow,&mdash;the bush thickens
round you,&mdash;it winds, it rises, it descends: all on a
sudden it opens with a bit of cleared ground full twenty
yards in extent, and a felled tree in the midst. Here let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
us pause, and, kneeling on the turf, uncovered, pour
forth the voice of health, of cheerfulness, and gratitude
to Him who guides and guards us on our way. And
now, onward again. The land falls suddenly, and we
cross a brook, which a child may stride, but whose
waters are a blessing both to man and beast. And now
we rise again; the country is cleared; there is a flock of
sheep, and a man looking after them; to the left, a farmhouse,
offices, &amp;c.; before us the spire of St. James&#8217;s,
Sydney, perhaps three miles distant, the metropolitan
church of the new empire, and, a little to the right, the
rival building of the Roman church. Beneath us lies
Sydney, the base-born mother of this New World,
covering a large extent of ground, and, at the extreme
point of land, the signal station, with the flags displayed,
betokening the arrival of a ship from England.
Till now we have met with no living creature, but here,
perhaps, the chaise with Sydney tradesman and his wife,
the single horseman, and a straggler or two on foot,
begin to appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general appearance of the coast of New Holland
is said to be very barren and forbidding, much more so
than the shores of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land are; and it thus
often happens that strangers are agreeably disappointed
by finding extreme richness and fertility in many parts
of a country, which at their first landing afforded no
such promises of excellence. One of the most dreary
and most curious descriptions of country is to be met
with on the north-western shores of New Holland,
quite on the opposite coast to that where the principal
English colony is situated. The daring explorer of this
north-western coast, Captain Grey, has given a fearful
account of his dangers and adventures among the barren
sandstone hills of this district. Its appearance, upon his
landing at Hanover Bay, was that of a line of lofty cliffs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
occasionally broken by sandy beaches; on the summits
of these cliffs, and behind the beaches, rose rocky sandstone
hills, very thinly wooded. Upon landing, the
shore was found to be exceedingly steep and broken;
indeed the hills are stated to have looked like the <em>ruins
of hills</em>, being composed of huge blocks of red sandstone,
confusedly piled together in loose disorder, and so overgrown
with various creeping plants, that the holes
between them were completely hidden, and into these
one or other of the party was continually slipping and
falling. The trees were so small and so scantily covered
with leaves that they gave no shelter from the heat of
the sun, which was reflected by the soil with intense
force, so that it was really painful to touch, or even to
stand upon, the bare sandstone. Excessive thirst soon
began to be felt, and the party, unprepared for this, had
only two pints of water with them, a portion of which
they were forced to give to their dogs; all three of these,
however, died of exhaustion. After a vain search of
some hours, at length the welcome cry of &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; was
heard from one of the party; but, alas! upon scrambling
down the deep and difficult ravine where the water
ran, it was found to be quite salty, and they were compelled
to get up again as well as they could, unrefreshed
and disheartened. After following the course of the
deep valley upwards about half a mile, they looked
down and saw some birds ascending from the thick
woods growing below, and, knowing these white cockatoos
to be a sure sign of water very near, the weary
party again descended, and found a pool of brackish
water, which, in their situation, appeared to afford the
most delicious draughts, although they shortly afterwards
paid the penalty of yet more intolerable thirst,
arising from making too free with a beverage of such
quality.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
The nature of the country near Hanover Bay, where
the party belonging to Captain Grey was exploring, is
most remarkable. The summits of the ranges of sandstone
hills were generally a level sort of table-land, but
this level was frequently broken and sometimes nearly
covered with lofty detached pillars of rock, forming the
most curious shapes in their various grouping. In one
place they looked like the aisle of a church unroofed, in
another there stood, upon a huge base, what appeared
to be the legs of an ancient statue, from which the body
had been knocked away; and fancy might make out
many more such resemblances. Some of these time-worn
sandy columns were covered with sweet-smelling
creepers, and their bases were hidden by various plants
growing thickly around them. The tops of all were
nearly on a level, and the height of those that were measured
was upwards of forty feet. The cause of this
singular appearance of the country was at length discovered
by the noise of water running under the present
surface, in the hollows of the sandstone, and gradually
carrying away the soil upon which the top surface rests.
Formerly, no doubt, the level of the whole country was
even with the tops of the broken pillars, and much higher;
and hereafter what is now at the surface will give way
beneath the wasting of the streams that flow below, and
no traces of its present height will be left, except in
those places where the power of the water is less felt,
which will rear up their lofty heads, and bear witness by
their presence of the ruin that will have taken place.</p>

<p>In wandering through a country of this description,
how natural does the following little remark of Captain
Grey appear! A plant was observed here, which, in
appearance and smell, exactly resembled the jasmine of
England; and it would be difficult to give an idea of the
feeling of pleasure derived from the sight of this simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
emblem of home. But, while the least plant or tree
that could remind them of home was gladly welcomed,
there were many new and remarkable objects to engage
the attention of the travellers. Among these the large
green ants, and the gouty stem tree may be particularly
noticed. The ants are, it would seem, confined to the
sandstone country, and are very troublesome. The gouty
stem tree is so named from the resemblance borne by its
immense trunk to the limb of a gouty person. It is an
unsightly but very useful tree, producing an agreeable
and nourishing fruit, as well as a gum and bark that may
be prepared for food. Upon some of these trees were
found the first rude efforts of savages to gain the art of
writing, being a number of marks, supposed to denote the
quantity of fruit gathered from the tree each year, all but
the last row being constantly scratched out, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/imgtally.png" width="300" height="75" alt="tally markings" title="" />
</div>

<p>But, miserable as the general appearance of that part
of the north-western coast of New Holland undoubtedly
is, yet are there many rich and lovely spots to
be found in its neighbourhood; and, further inland,
vast tracts of fertile country appear to want only civilised
and Christian men for their inhabitants. What is
wanting in the ensuing picture but civilisation and religion,
in order to make it as perfect as any earthly
abode can be? &ldquo;From the summit of the hills on which
we stood,&rdquo; (says Captain Grey) &ldquo;an almost precipitous
descent led into a fertile plain below; and, from this
part, away to the southward, for thirty to forty miles,
stretched a low, luxuriant country, broken by conical
peaks and rounded hills, which were richly clothed
with grass to their very summits. The plains and hills
were both thinly wooded, and curving lines of shady
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
trees marked out the courses of numerous streams.&rdquo;
This beautiful prospect was over a volcanic district,
and with the sandstone which they were just leaving,
they were bidding farewell to barrenness and desolation.
It was near this beautiful spot, and in a country
no less rich and delightful, that the party of adventurers
was overtaken by the violent rains, which occur in
those hot climates, and which struck the men with so
great chill, that they were driven to make trial of an
odd way of getting warm. Some of them got into a
stream, the waters of which were comparatively warm,
and thus saved themselves from the painful feeling
arising from the very cold rain falling on the pores of
the skin, which had previously been opened by continued
perspiration.</p>

<p>The rains appear during the wet season to fall very
heavily and constantly in North-Western Australia, and
though a good supply of these is an advantage to an
occupied country, well provided with roads, it is a great
cause of trouble to first explorers who have to find a ford
over every stream, and a passage across every swamp,
and who often run the risk of getting into a perfectly
impassable region. Of this sort, alike differing from the
barren sandstone and the volcanic fertile country, was
a third track through which Captain Grey endeavoured
to pass. A vast extent of land lying low and level near
the banks of the river Glenelg,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and well fitted, if
properly drained, for the abundant growth of useful
and valuable produce, was found, during the rainy
season, to be in the state of a foul marsh, overgrown
with vegetation, choking up the fresh water so as to
cause a flood ankle-deep; and this marshy ground,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
being divided by deep muddy ditches, and occasionally
overflown by the river, offered, as may be supposed, no
small hindrances to the progress of the travellers. In
some places it was quite impossible, from the thickly-timbered
character of its banks, to approach the main
stream; in others they appeared to be almost entirely
surrounded by sluggish waters, of which they knew
neither the depth nor the nature of their banks. Elsewhere,
unable to cross some deep stream, the explorers
were driven miles out of their way, and sometimes even
in their tents, the water stood to the depth of two or
three inches. On one occasion, when the party was
almost surrounded by swamps, their loaded ponies sank
nearly up to the shoulders in a bog, whichever way
they attempted to move, and from this spot they had
two miles to travel before they could reach the nearest
rising ground. The river Glenelg was at this time
overflowing its banks, and, to the natural alarm of men
wandering in its rich valley, drift-wood, reeds, grass,
&amp;c. were seen lodged in the trees above their heads,
fifteen feet beyond the present level of the water,
affording a proof of what floods in that country <em>had
been</em>, and, of course, <em>might be</em> again. However, this very
soil in so warm a climate, only about sixteen degrees
south of the equator, would be admirably fitted for the
cultivation of rice, which needs abundance of moisture.
But little do the peaceful inhabitants of a cultivated
country, well drained, and provided with bridges and
good roads, think of the risk and hardships undergone
by the first explorers of a new land, however great
its capabilities, and whatever may be its natural advantages.</p>

<p>But it was not in the plain country alone, that Captain
Grey found spots of great richness and fertility,
as the following description of the happy vallies frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
found among the mountain-ranges may testify:
One may be chosen as a specimen of many. At its
northern end it was about four miles wide, being
bounded on all sides by rocky, wooded ranges, with dark
gullies from which numerous petty streams run down
into the main one in the centre. The valley gradually
grows narrow towards the south, and is bounded by
steep cliffs betwixt which the waters find an outlet.
Sometimes a valley of this kind, most beautiful, most
productive, will contain from four to five thousand
acres of nearly level land, shut out from the rest of the
world by the boundary of hills that enclose it. How
great a contrast to these lovely vallies does the description,
given by another traveller in a different district,
present! Nothing, according to Mr. Oxley&#8217;s account,
can be more monotonous and wearying, than the dull,
unvarying aspect of the level and desolate region
through which the Lachlan winds its sluggish course.
One tree, one soil, one water, and one description of
bird, fish, or animal, prevails alike for ten miles, and
for a hundred. And, if we turn from this to a third
picture of desolation mingled with sublimity, the contrast
appears yet more heightened. Among the hills
behind Port Macquarrie on the eastern coast, Mr.
Oxley came suddenly upon the spot where a river, (the
Apsley,) leaves the gently-rising and fine country
through which it had been passing, and falls into a
deep glen. At this spot the country seems cleft in
twain, and divided to its very foundation, a ledge of
rocks separates the waters, which, falling over a perpendicular
rock, 235 feet in height, form a grand cascade.
At a distance of 300 yards, and an elevation of as many
feet, the travellers were wetted with the spray. After
winding through the cleft rocks about 400 yards, the
river again falls, in one single sheet, upwards of 100
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
feet, and continues, in a succession of smaller falls, about
a quarter of a mile lower, where the cliffs are of a
perpendicular height, on each side exceeding 1,200 feet;
the width of the edges being about 200 yards. From
thence it descends, as before described, until all sight of
it is lost from the vast elevation of the rocky hills, which
it divides and runs through. The different points of
this deep glen, seem as if they would fit into the
opposite openings forming the smaller glens on either
side.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Amid scenery like that which has now been described,
varying from grandeur to tameness, from fertility to
barrenness, from extreme beauty to extreme ugliness,
but always possessing, at least, the recommendation of
being <em>new</em>, the wanderers in the Bush are delighted to
range. There is a charm to enterprising spirits in the
freedom, the stillness, and even in the dangers and
privations, of these vast wilds, which, to such spirits,
scenes of a more civilised character can never possess.
If it be true,&mdash;and who has never felt it to be so?&mdash;that</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;God made the country and man made the town,&rdquo;</p>

<p>much more distinctly is God&#8217;s power visible in the
lonely wastes of Australia, much more deeply do men
feel, while passing through those regions, that it is His
hand that has planted the wilderness with trees, and
peopled the desert with living things. Under these
impressions men learn to delight in exploring the bush,
and when they meet, as they often do, with sweet spots,
on which Nature has secretly lavished her choicest
gifts, most thoroughly do they enjoy, most devotedly do
they admire, their beauty. In travelling some miles to
the northward of Perth, a town on the Swan River,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Captain Grey fell in with a charming scene, which he
thus describes: &ldquo;Our&rdquo; station, &ldquo;this night, had a
beauty about it, which would have made any one, possessed
with the least enthusiasm, fall in love with a
bush life. We were sitting on a gently-rising ground,
which sloped away gradually to a picturesque lake,
surrounded by wooded hills,&mdash;while the moon shone so
brightly on the lake, that the distance was perfectly
clear, and we could distinctly see the large flocks of
wild fowl, as they passed over our heads, and then
splashed into the water, darkening and agitating its
silvery surface; in front of us blazed a cheerful fire,
round which were the dark forms of the natives, busily
engaged in roasting ducks for us; the foreground was
covered with graceful grass-trees, and, at the moment
we commenced supper, I made the natives set fire to
the dried tops of two of these, and by the light of
these splendid chandeliers, which threw a red glare
over the whole forest in our vicinity, we ate our evening
meal; then, closing round the fire, rolled ourselves
up in our blankets, and laid down to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very same feeling of religion, which heightens
the pleasures and gives a keener relish to the enjoyments
of life in these lonely places, can also afford
comfort, and hope, and encouragement under those
perils and privations which first explorers must undergo.
Religion is the sun that brightens our summer hours,
and gives us, even through the darkest and most stormy
day, light, and confidence, and certainty. And when a
small body of men are left alone, as it were, in the
wilderness with their God, whatever occurs to them,
whether of a pleasing or of a trying character, is likely
to lift up their souls to their Maker, in whom &ldquo;they
live and move, and have their being.&rdquo; When the
patient traveller, of whose adventures in Western
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Australia so much mention has been made, had waited
weather-bound on a lonely coast, never before trodden
by the foot of civilised man, until eight days had been
consumed in watching to no purpose the winds and the
waves,&mdash;when, at a distance of thousands of miles from
their native country, and many hundreds of miles from
the nearest English colony, he and his little party were
wasting strength and provisions in a desert spot; from
which their only means of escaping was in one frail
boat, which the fury of the sea forbade them to think of
launching upon the deep,&mdash;when the men, under these
circumstances, were becoming more and more gloomy
and petulant, where was it that the commander sought
and found consolation? It was in religion. And the
witness of one who has successfully gone through trials
of this kind, is well deserving of the utmost attention.
&ldquo;I feel assured,&rdquo; says Captain Grey, in his account of
this trial of patience, &ldquo;that, but for the support I
derived from prayer, and frequent perusal and meditation
of the Scriptures, I should never have been able to
have borne myself in such a manner as to have maintained
discipline and confidence amongst the rest of the
party; nor in all my sufferings did I ever lose the
consolation derived from a firm reliance upon the goodness
of Providence. It is only those who go forth into
perils and dangers, amidst which human foresight and
strength can but little avail, and who find themselves,
day after day, protected by an unseen influence, and
ever and again snatched from the very jaws of destruction,
by a power which is not of this world, who can at
all estimate the knowledge of one&#8217;s own weakness and
littleness, and the firm reliance and trust upon the
goodness of the Creator, which the human breast is
capable of feeling. Like all other lessons which are of
great and lasting benefit to man, this one must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
learned amid much sorrowing and woe; but, having
learned it, it is but the sweeter from the pain and toil
which are undergone in the acquisition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of these trials to which travellers in the
bush are peculiarly liable, brings naturally to mind that
worst of all privations, a want of water, to which they
are so frequently exposed. The effects of extreme thirst
are stated to have been shown, not merely in weakness
and want, in a parched and burning mouth, but likewise
in a partial loss of the senses of seeing and hearing.
Indeed, the powers of the whole frame are affected, and,
upon moving, after a short interval of rest, the blood
rushes up into the head with a fearful and painful violence.
A party of men reduced to this condition have
very little strength, either of mind or body, left them,
and it is stated, that, in cases of extreme privation, the
worst characters have always least control over their
appetites.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Imagine men marching through a barren
and sandy country, a thirsty land where no water is, at
the rate of about two miles in an hour and a quarter,
when, suddenly, they come upon the edge of a dried-up
swamp, and behold the footmark of a native, imprinted
on the sand,&mdash;the first beginning of hope, a sign of
animal life, which of course implies the means of supporting
it. Many more footsteps are soon seen, and
some wells of the natives are next discovered, but alas!
all appear dry. Kaiber, a native companion of the
party, suddenly starts up from a bed of reeds, where he
has been burying his head in a hole of <em>soft mud</em>, with
which he had completely swelled himself out, and of
which he had helped himself to pretty well half the
supply. It is so thick that it needs straining through a
handkerchief, yet so welcome, after three days and two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
nights of burning thirst, under a fierce sun, that each
man throws himself down beside the hole, exclaiming
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; and then greedily swallows a few mouthfulls
of the liquid mud, declaring it to be the most delicious
water, with a peculiar flavour, better than any that
had ever before been tasted by him. Upon scraping the
mud quite out of the hole, water begins slowly to trickle
in again.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> As might be expected, game abounds here,
driven by the general dryness of the country to these
springs. But the trembling hand of a man worn down
by fatigue and thirst is not equal to wield a gun, or
direct its fire to any purpose; so it seems as if thirst
were escaped for a time, in order that hunger might
occupy its place. At length, however, the native kills a
cockatoo, which had been wounded by a shot; and this
bird, with a spoonful of flour to each man, and a tolerable
abundance of liquid mud, becomes the means of saving
the lives of the party.</p>

<p>Such is the picture, taken from life, of some of the
privations undergone, during dry seasons, in certain
portions of the bush, and we must, at the risk of being
tedious, repeat again the witness of a military man, of
one who has seen much of the world, respecting the
best source of comfort and support under these distressing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
trials. At such times, upon halting, when the others
of the party would lie wearily down, and brood over
their melancholy state, Captain Grey would keep his
journal, (a most useful repository of facts,) and this duty
being done, he would open a small New Testament, his
companion through all his wanderings, from which book
he drank in such deep draughts of comfort, that his
spirits were always good. And on another occasion, he
shared the last remaining portion of provision with his
native servant; after which he actually felt glad that it
was gone, and that he no longer had to struggle with
the pangs of hunger, and put off eating it to a future
hour. Having completed this last morsel, he occupied
himself a little with his journal, then read a few chapters
in the New Testament, and, after fulfilling these
duties, he felt himself as contented and cheerful as ever
he had been in the most fortunate moments of his life.</p>

<p>As in life, those objects which we have not, but of
which we think we stand in need, are ever present to
our fancy, so in these thirsty soils the mere appearance
of that water, of which the reality would be so grateful,
is frequently known to mock the sight of man. A remarkable
specimen of this was seen at the plains of
Kolaina (Deceit), in North-Western Australia. From a
sand hill, not very far from the coast, was seen a splendid
view of a noble lake, dotted about with many beautiful
islands. The water had a glassy and fairy-like
appearance, and it was an imposing feeling to sit down
alone on the lofty eminence, and survey the great lake
on which no European eye had ever before rested, and
which was cut off from the sea by a narrow and lofty
ridge of sandy hills. It was proposed at once to launch
the boats upon this water, but a little closer survey was
thought prudent, and then it proved that the lake was
not so near as it had seemed to be, and that there were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
extensive plains of mud and sand lying between it and
the rising ground. It appeared to be about a mile distant,
and all were still certain that it was water they
saw, for the shadows of the low hills near it, as well as
those of the trees upon them, could be distinctly traced
on the unruffled surface.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As they advanced, the water
retreated, and at last surrounded them. The party now
saw that they were deceived by <em>mirage</em>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or vapour,
which changed the sandy mud of the plains they were
crossing into the resemblance, at a distance, of a noble
piece of water. In reading the history of mankind, how
often may we apply this disappointment to moral objects!
how very frequently do the mistaken eyes of mortals
eagerly gaze upon the <em>mirage</em> raised by falsehood, as
though they were beholding the living waters of truth
itself! What appearance, indeed, does the whole world
present to one who rests upon the everlasting hill of
the gospel,&mdash;the rock upon which Christ&#8217;s church has
been built,&mdash;except it be that of one vast plain of Kolaina,
or deceit? It was no long time after the explorers of the
north-western coast of New Holland had been mocked
by the <em>mirage</em> or vapour which has just been spoken of,
that they had a fearful lesson of the vain and shadowy
nature of human hopes and expectations. When they
had first arrived off the coast, on that expedition, they
had chosen an island, named Bernier Island, upon which
to bury, for the sake of safety, their stores and provisions,
so that they might return to them whenever it
should be necessary. Bernier Island is a barren spot,
formed of limestone, shells, and sand, and without a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
single tree or blade of grass upon it, but only wretched,
scrubby bushes, amidst which the light sand and shells
are drifted by the winds. Such was the remote spot,
surrounded by the ocean&#8217;s waves, yet not very far from
the main shore, upon which it was resolved to conceal
their store of necessaries, secure, as it was supposed,
from every enemy. In little more than three weeks,
during which the adventurers had gone through many
perils, and much stormy weather, they returned again,
not without some difficulty, to their stores. But on
approaching Bernier Island with their boat they scarcely
knew it again, so vast a difference had the recent storms
made in its outward appearance, so fearful were the
pranks which the hurricane had played upon a land
which was, in fact, nothing but loose sand, heaped upon
a bed of limestone. The place where their stores had
been securely left was gone, the remains of the flour-casks,
salt provisions, &amp;c. were scattered about in various
directions; and the whole spot so entirely altered that it
could hardly be ascertained, except by the fragments
that were seen near it. How to get back again to Swan
River, the nearest British settlement, without provisions,
without water, without strength, was indeed a
perplexing inquiry, and to answer this the leader of
the party, having left his companions for a while, set
himself seriously to work. Sitting down upon a
rock on the shore, he felt the gale blowing fiercely in his
face, and the spray of the breakers dashing over him;
nothing could be more gloomy and dreary. Inland, no
objects were to be seen but a mere bed of rock covered
with drifting sand, on which were growing stunted,
scrubby bushes; and former experience taught him,
that no fresh water was to be found in the island.
Several plans of escape, all apparently alike hopeless,
offered themselves to his mind, and, more fully to compose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
himself, he took forth his constant companion in
the wilderness, and read a few chapters of Holy Writ.
Contentment and resignation were thus in some degree
gained, and he soon joined the rest of the party, having
resolved upon that plan, which God&#8217;s providence and
mercy finally enabled him to carry out, without losing,
from a party of twelve, constantly exposed during a very
long journey to most dreadful toils, hunger, and thirst,
more than one man only, who died at no great distance
from the English colony. That one person was a youth
of eighteen years of age, who had come out from
England, led solely by an enterprising spirit, and not
with any view of settling. On the return of the party
under Captain Grey towards Swan River, they were so
sadly pinched by want of provisions, and by thirst, that
five of them were obliged to start with their leader, in
order to reach the British colony by forced marches, and
Frederick Smith, the youthful adventurer, was one of
those that remained behind. After undergoing extreme
trials, which from his age he was less able to bear than
the others, he, at last, became quite worn out, and
sat down, one evening, on a bank, declaring that he could
go no further. He was behind the rest of the party, and
the man who was with him went and told his companions
that he thought Smith was dying. The next
morning that man went back for him; but, being
himself very weak, he did not go far enough, at all
events he did not find him. Probably, the poor sufferer
had crawled a little out of the track, for, afterwards,
when a party was sent from Swan River in search of
him, they traced, with the help of a native, his footsteps
up a bare sand hill to the height of twelve or fourteen
feet, and there, turning about to the left, they found the
object of their search stretched lifeless upon his back, in
the midst of a thick bush, where he seemed to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
laid down to sleep, being half wrapped up in his blanket.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
All his little articles of baggage were very near him, and,
from the posture in which he was found, it appeared
that the immediate cause of his death was a rush of
blood to the head, which would occasion no great
suffering in his last moments. A grave was scraped in
the sand by the searching party, and Frederic Smith was
buried in the wilderness wherein he had died, and which
he had been among the first to explore, about seventy-six
miles northward of the Swan River. The grave was
made smooth, and a piece of wood found upon the
neighbouring beach was placed at its head, and then the
solitary spot was forsaken for ever by the mourning
companions of the departed youth, who left</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Heaven&#8217;s fresh gales, and the ocean&#8217;s wave,</span><br />
 Alternate to sigh o&#8217;er the wanderer&#8217;s grave.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It was only six weeks before this untimely end of the
young explorer, that he had set out, full of hope, on the
long journey by the coast, which the party made on
their return, and had been a leading character in such
beautiful pictures of life in the Australian wilderness as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
this which is given by his friend Captain Grey. &ldquo;We
soon found ourselves at the foot of a lofty cascade, down
which a little water was slowly dropping; and, on
climbing to its summit, it appeared to be so well fitted
for a halting-place for the night, that I determined to
remain there. The men made themselves comfortable
near the water-holes, and Mr. Smith and myself crept
into a little cave, which occasionally served as a resting-place
for the natives, the remains of whose fires were
scattered about. A wild woodland and rocky scenery
was around us; and when the moon rose and shed her
pale light over all, I sat with Mr. Smith on the edge of the
waterfall, gazing by turns into the dim woody abyss
below, and at the red fires and picturesque groups of
the men, than which fancy could scarcely imagine a
wilder scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is no uncommon mistake, with persons who ought
to know better, to magnify the toils and hardships
endured by the body, while those labours and anxieties
that the mind undergoes are disregarded and forgotten.
Every man engaged in an exploring party in the bush,
for instance, has his severe trials to go through, but
their trials are not to be compared to those of the commander
of the party. How often when the rest are
sleeping must he be watchful? How frequently, while
others are gay, must he feel thoughtful! These remarks
may easily be applied to the following description of
the coast near Shark&#8217;s Bay, in the N. W. of the island
of New Holland. There was great beauty in the scenery,
both the sky and the water had that peculiar brilliancy
about them to be seen only in fine weather, and in a very
warm climate. To the west lay a boundless extent of
sea, to the eastward was a low shore fringed with trees,
not only down to the water&#8217;s edge, but forming little
green knots of foliage in the ocean itself; behind these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
trees were low wooded hills, and in front of them were
numbers of pelicans and water-fowl. There was only
about three feet depth of clear transparent water,
through which were seen many beautiful and large shells,
and various strange-looking fish, at some of which last
one or other of Captain Grey&#8217;s men would sometimes
make an attack, while loud peals of laughter would rise
from the rest, when the pursuer, too anxious to gain his
object, would miss his stroke at the fish, or, stumbling,
roll headlong in the water. The fineness of the day,
the novelty of the scenery, and the rapid way they
were making, made the poor fellows forget past dangers,
as well as those they had yet to undergo. But this was
more than their commander was able to do. &ldquo;My own
meditations,&rdquo; adds Captain Grey, &ldquo;were of a more
melancholy character, for I feared that the days of some
of the light-hearted group were already numbered, and
would soon be brought to a close. Amid such scenes
and thoughts we were swept along, while this unknown
coast, which so many had anxiously yet vainly wished
to see, passed before our eyes like a dream, and ere
many more years have hurried by, it is possible that the
recollection of this day may be as such to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the wonders of Nature to be met with in the
Australian bush, the large rivers occasionally dried up
to their very lowest depth by the extreme drought, are
very remarkable. Few natural objects can equal in
beauty and utility a river in its proper state,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;</span><br />
 Strong without rage, without o&#8217;erflowing full;&rdquo;</p>

<p>but few can exceed in terror and destruction a large
river in time of flood; while nothing, surely, can surpass
in horror and desolation the same object when its
stream is wasted, its waters disappeared, its usefulness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and beauty alike gone. This spectacle is, fortunately,
but rarely seen, except in Australia, and even there only
after very dry seasons. One river seen in this state
consisted of several channels or beds, divided from each
other by long strips of land, which in times of flood
become islands; the main channel was about 270 yards
in breadth, and the height of its bank was about fifteen
feet. After the exploring party had passed the highest
point in the channel to which the tide flowed from
the sea, this huge river bed was perfectly dry, and
looked the most mournful, deserted spot imaginable.
Occasionally water-holes were found eighteen or twenty
feet in depth, and it is from these alone that travellers
have been enabled to satisfy their thirst in crossing
over the unexplored parts of the bush, where no water
could elsewhere be obtained. Still, notwithstanding the
extreme drought by which they were surrounded, the
strangers could see by the remaining drift wood, which
had been washed high up into the neighbouring trees,
what rapid and overpowering currents sometimes swept
along the now dry channel.</p>

<p>On another occasion the same singular object is
powerfully described, and the feelings of men, who had
long been in need of water, at beholding a sight like this
can scarcely be imagined. Beneath them lay the dry
bed of a large river, its depth at this point being between
forty and fifty feet, and its breadth upwards of 300 yards;
it was at times subject to terrible floods, for along its
banks lay the trunks of immense trees, giants of the
forest, which had been formerly washed down from the
interior of the country; yet nothing now met their
craving eyes but a vast sandy channel, which scorched
their eyeballs, as the rays of the sun were reflected back
from its white, glistening bed. Above and below this
spot, however, large pools of water were found, and even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
here, when a hole of a few inches depth was scraped in
the dry channel, it soon became filled with water which
oozed into it from the sand. At another stream, which
the same exploring party afterwards fell in with, they
were less successful, and found all the pools entirely dry.
The sun was intensely hot, and the poor men grew faint
for want of water, while it heightened their sufferings,
that they stood upon the brink of a river, or wandered
along its banks with eager, piercing eyes, and an air of
watchfulness peculiar to those who seek for that on
which their lives depend. One while they explored a
shallow, stony part of the bed, which was parched up
and blackened by the fiery sun: their steps were slow
and listless, and it was plainly to be seen how faint,
weak, and weary they were; the next minute another
pool would be seen ahead, the depth of which the eye
could not at a distance reach; now they hurried on
towards it with a dreadful look of eager anxiety&mdash;the
pool was reached&mdash;the bottom seen; but, alas! no water:
then they paused, and looked one at the other with an
air of utter despair. The order to march from this
distressing spot was unwillingly and slowly obeyed. So
fondly does the human soul cling to the very faintest
semblance of hope, that the adventurers would rather
have wandered up and down these barren and arid banks,
in vain search after water, than tear themselves away by
one bold effort from the deceitful expectations held out
to them by the empty channel.</p>

<p>It was on his return from a journey attended by perils
and privations like these, that Captain Grey relates the
following simple occurrence, which may help to make
men value more highly, or rather prize more justly, the
many little comforts they may possess: The Captain
had left some of his men behind, and was hastening with
all speed to the settlement of Perth, in Western Australia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in order to get assistance and necessaries for
them. Starting an hour and a half before daylight, he
reached the hut of Williams, the farthest settler, north
of Perth, in time to find the wife and another woman at
breakfast. He had known Mrs. Williams, and, forgetting
how strangely want and suffering had changed his
appearance for the worse, he expected her to remember
him again. But he was mistaken for a crazy Malay,
nicknamed Magic, who used to visit the houses of the
out-settlers. Hurt at his reception, &ldquo;I am not Magic,&rdquo;
exclaimed he. &ldquo;Well then, my good man, who are
you?&rdquo; inquired they, laughing. &ldquo;One who is almost
starved,&rdquo; was his solemn reply. &ldquo;Will you take this,
then?&rdquo; said the hostess, handing him a cup of tea she
was raising to her lips. &ldquo;With all my heart and soul,
and God reward you for it,&rdquo; was the answer; and he
swallowed the delicious draught. Who can fail of
being reminded, upon reading this anecdote, of those
gracious and beautiful words of his Redeemer&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever
shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto
you, he shall not lose his reward&rdquo;? (Mark ix. 41.)</p>

<p>The mention of the out-settler&#8217;s hut, in which Captain
Grey met with this small, but most acceptable, kindness,
may serve to remind us of an object, which, although
not, strictly speaking, belonging to the bush, is, nevertheless,
very frequently seen in that part of the wild
country which is most visited,&mdash;the portions of it which
are adjoining to the British settlements. In these parts
of the bush the small hut of the humble out-settler may
often be espied; and, while we speak of the toils and
privations frequently undergone by this class of people
at first, we must not forget that they are thus opening
to themselves a way to future wealth and comfort.
Nor, be it recollected, is the condition of an out-settler
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in the Australian bush any more a fair average specimen
of that of the inhabitants of the colonies than the
owner of a mud-hovel raised on some English heath
would be of the inhabitants of the parish in which he
happens to dwell. One strong difference may be seen
in the two cases. In England the cottager must, in all
likelihood, live and die a cottager, as his fathers have
done before him, and his children will after him;
whereas, in the Australian colonies, with prudence and
the Divine blessing, (without which a man can do well
nowhere) the humble out-settler may gradually, yet
rapidly, grow up into the wealthy and substantial farmer
and landowner. Bearing in mind these facts, the following
sketch of the premises of an out-settler on the
river Williams, at the back of the Swan River settlement,
in Western Australia, may be at once instructive,
and not unsuitable to the subject of this chapter. The
house was made of a few upright poles, to which, at the
top, cross poles were fastened, and a covering of rude
thatch tied upon the whole. It was open at both ends,
and exposed to the wind, which, as the situation was
high, was very unpleasant. Here, however, were the
elements of future riches, a very large flock of sheep,
in fair condition, also a well-supplied stock-yard, and
cattle in beautiful order; while upwards of twenty dogs,
for hunting the kangaroo, completed the establishment.
The settlers were four in number, and, except four soldiers
quartered about sixteen miles from them, there
were no other Europeans within fifty miles of the spot.
All stores and necessaries were sent from a distance
of 120 miles, through a country without roads, and
exposed to the power of the native inhabitants. In
this but might be seen a lively picture of the trials
occasionally endured by <em>first settlers</em>; they had no flour,
tea, sugar, meat, or any provision whatever, except
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
their live stock and the milk of their cattle, their sole
dependence for any other article of food being the
kangaroo dogs, and the only thing their visitors were
able to do to better their situation was to leave them
some shot. All other circumstances were on the same
scale with them, and one, supposing them to have been
faithful members of the Church of their native land,
must have been the most grievous privation of all:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;The sound of the church-going bell</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those valleys and rocks never heard;</span><br />
 Never sighed at the sound of a knell,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor smiled when a sabbath appear&#8217;d.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>They had but one old clasp knife; there was but one
small bed, for one person, the others sleeping on the
ground every night, with little or no covering; they had
no soap to wash themselves or their clothes, yet they
submitted cheerfully to all these privations, considering
them to be necessary consequences of their situation.
Two of these out-settlers were gentlemen, not only by
birth, but also in thought and manner; nor can it be
doubted that they were really happier than many an
idle young man to be seen lounging about in England,
a burden to himself and to his friends. Idleness and
vice have often in England been the means of levelling
with the dust the lordly mansion, whilst industry, in the
wilds of Australia, can rear a comfortable dwelling
on the very spot where once stood the hut of the out-settler.</p>

<p>Scattered round the shores of New Holland at various
distances are many small islands and rocks, the prevailing
appearance of which is that of extreme barrenness.
On many of these it would seem that no human beings
had ever set their feet before the Europeans, and especially
the English, explored those coasts. In several
parts the natives were without any means of conveyance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
across even a narrow arm of the sea, and thus the brute
creation were left in a long and undisturbed possession
of many of the isles which lie near the main land. In
the more barren and miserable of these the bird called
the <em>sooty petrel</em>, and the seal, are the principal animals
to be found, whilst in those that are somewhat more
fruitful, kangaroos, also, and emus are to be found; the
smaller breed of kangaroos being usually met with in
the smaller islands, and the larger species on the main
land or in islands of a greater extent. The following
short account, by Captain Flinders, may serve as a specimen
of the lesser isles: Great flocks of petrels had
been noticed coming in from the sea to the island, and
early next morning, a boat was sent from the ship to
collect a quantity of them for food, and to kill seals, but
the birds were already moving off, and no more than
four seals, of the hair kind, were procured. Upon the
men going on shore, the island was found to be a rock
of granite, but this was covered with a crust of limestone
or chalk, in some places fifty feet thick. The soil
at the top was little better than sand, but was overspread
with shrubs, mostly of one kind, a whitish velvet-like
plant, amongst which the petrels, who make their
nests underground, had burrowed everywhere, and, from
the extreme heat of the sun, the reflection of it from the
sand, and frequently being sunk half way up the leg in
these holes, the sailors, little used to difficulties in
land-travelling, were scarcely able to reach the highest hill
near the middle of the island. It was in the neighbourhood
of scattered sandy spots of this description that
the sailors of Captain Flinders would often endeavour
successfully to improve their ordinary fare by catching a few
fish. On one occasion they were very much hindered by
three monstrous sharks, in whose presence no other fish
dared to appear. After some attempts, and with much difficulty,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
they took one of these creatures, and got it on
board the ship. In length it was no more than twelve
feet three inches, but the body measured eight feet round.
Among the vast quantity of things contained in the
stomach was a tolerably large seal, bitten in two, and swallowed
with half of the spear sticking in it, with which it
had probably been killed by the natives. The stench of
this ravenous monster was great, even before it was dead;
and, when the stomach was opened, it became intolerable.</p>

<p>Quite contrary, in many respects, to these sandy
islands, and yet but little superior to them in fruitfulness,
are some of those which were visited by the same enterprising
voyager on the eastern coast of Australia.
Their shores were very low, so much so, that frequently
a landing is impossible, and generally very difficult, on
account of the mud; and often a vast quantity of mangrove
trees are found growing in the swamps that
surround the shores, and choking the soil with a rank
vegetation. On one of these islands when a landing had
been effected without a very great deal of trouble, and a
rising ground was reached, the sides of this little eminence
were found to be so steep, and were so thickly
covered with trees and shrubs, bound together and
interlaced with strong plants, resembling vines in their
growth, that all attempts to reach the top of the hill
were without success. It appeared to be almost easier
to have climbed up the trees, and have scrambled from
one to another upon the vines, than to have threaded a
way through the perplexing net-work formed by these
plants, beneath which all was darkness and uncertainty.</p>

<p>There are, however, some few islands, which promise
to become, at a future time, inhabited and cultivated
spots, being neither so entirely naked, nor yet so choked
up by a poor and hungry vegetation concealing a thin
soil, as those already described. Of these more smiling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
spots the large island, off the western coast, called
Kangaroo Island, may serve for a specimen. A thick
wood covered almost all that part of the island which
was seen from the ship by Captain Flinders, but the
trees that were alive were not so large as those lying on
the ground, nor as the dead trees still standing upright.
Those upon the ground were so abundant, that, in
ascending the higher land, a considerable part of the
walk was upon them. No inhabitants were seen in the
island, but yet it seemed, from the appearance of the
trees, as though, at the distance of some years, the
woods had been destroyed by fire. The soil, so far as
it was seen, was thought very good, and the trees
bore witness of this by their size and growth; yet
so frequently do travellers, like doctors, disagree, that
another explorer, Captain Sturt, pronounces this spot
to be not by any means fertile. The quantity of kangaroos
found here was remarkable enough to give a
name to the island; and so entirely were these harmless
animals strangers to the power of man, that they suffered
themselves to be approached and killed without
any efforts to escape. Captain Flinders, on the first day
of landing, killed ten, and the rest of his party made up
the number to thirty-one taken on board in the course
of the day, the least weighing 69 and the largest 125 lbs.
The whole ship&#8217;s company were employed that afternoon
in skinning and cleaning the kangaroos, and a
delightful feast they afforded to men who for four
months had scarcely tasted any fresh provisions. Never,
perhaps, had the dominion held here by these creatures
been before disturbed; the seals, indeed, shared it with
the kangaroos on the shores, but they seemed to dwell
peacefully together, each animal occasionally wandering
into the haunts of the other, so that a gun fired at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
kangaroo upon the beach would sometimes bring forth
two or three bellowing seals from underneath bushes a
good deal further from the water-side. The seal, indeed,
was the most knowing creature of the two, for its actions
bespoke that it distinguished the sailors from kangaroos,
whereas the latter not uncommonly appeared to mistake
them for seals. Indeed it is curious to trace the total
absence of all knowledge of man in these distant isles of
Australia. In another island a white eagle was seen
making a motion to pounce down upon the British
sailors, whom it evidently took for kangaroos, never,
probably, having seen an upright animal, (except that,
when moving upon its hind legs,) and naturally, therefore,
mistaking the men for its usual prey.</p>

<p>In another part of Kangaroo Island, which was afterwards
visited, a large piece of water was discovered at
the head of a bay, and in this water an immense number
of pelicans were seen; upon some small islets were
found many young birds yet unable to fly, and upon the
surrounding beach a great number of old ones were seen,
while the bones and skeletons of many lay scattered
about. So that it appeared to be at once the breeding-place
and death-bed of these birds, who, in the hidden
bosom of a quiet lake, in an uninhabited island, had long
continued to extend their race, generation after generation
retiring to the same spot where they were first
brought to light, and there ending their days in tranquillity.
In this part of the island kangaroos were less
plentiful than in the other, but the soil appeared equally
promising, and in all likelihood, before many years have
flown by, trees, seals, kangaroos, and pelicans will all
be forced to give up their old domains, and be destroyed
before the pressing wants and daring spirit of the British
emigrant. One important hindrance is noticed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Flinders,&mdash;the scarcity of water,&mdash;but the presence of so
many animals shows that there is an abundance somewhere,
though he could find but a scanty supply in one
single spot. In Kangaroo Island only one accident
occurred which showed any disposition or power on the
part of its old inhabitants to wage war with the intruders.
One of the sailors having attacked a large seal
without proper caution, was so severely bitten in the
leg, that he was not merely laid up in consequence of
this hurt, but was obliged to be discharged, three months
afterwards, when the ship was refitted at Sydney.</p>

<p>In addition to the numerous barren rocks and the few
tolerably large wooded islands, which encircle the shores
of Australia, there is a third description of isles or rocks,
which must not be passed over altogether without notice.
The substance called <em>coral</em> is well known in Europe, but
with us the name connects itself with very different
objects from those to which it is related in Australia.
<em>Here</em> female ornaments and toys for infants are almost
the only objects to be seen that are formed of coral;
<em>there</em> it forms the most stupendous rocks or reefs, which
serve frequently for a foundation to islands of no mean
size; indeed, in one part of the north-eastern coast of
Australia, the coral reefs are known to extend not less
than 350 miles in a straight line, without a single
opening of any magnitude occurring in them.</p>

<p>Among these, surrounded by dangers, did Captain
Flinders sail, during fourteen days, for more than 500
miles before he could escape into less perilous seas.
Upon landing on one of these reefs, when the water was
clear, the view underneath, from the edge of the rocks,
was extremely beautiful. Quite a new creation, but
still not unlike the old, was offered to the view. There
appeared wheat-sheaves, mushrooms, stags&#8217; horns, cabbage-leaves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and a variety of other forms, glowing under
water with brilliant tints, of every shade betwixt green,
purple, brown, and white; equalling in beauty and surpassing
in grandeur the most favourite flower-bed of the
curious florist. These appearances were, in fact, different
sorts of <em>coral</em>, and fungus, growing, as it were, out
of the solid rock, and each had its own peculiar form
and shade of colouring, but yet the spectators, who knew
their ship to be hemmed in by rocks of this material,
while considering the richness of the scene, could not
long forget with what power of destruction it was gifted.</p>

<p>The cause of these coral rocks and islands, which are
slowly, but certainly, increasing, is a very small marine
insect, by which the substance called coral is formed.
These work under water, generation after generation
contributing its share in the construction of what, in the
course of ages, becomes a solid rock, exalting its head
above the face of the surrounding waters, and rising
sometimes from the depth of 200 fathoms, and perhaps
even more. To be constantly covered with water seems
necessary to these minute animals, for they do not work,
except in holes upon the reef, beyond low-water-mark;
but the coral and other broken remains thrown up by
the sea lodge upon the rock and form a solid mass with
it, as high as the common tides reach. The new bank
is not long left unvisited by sea-birds; salt-plants take
root upon it, and a kind of soil begins to be formed; a
cocoa-nut,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> or the seed of some other tree, is thrown on
shore; land-birds visit it, and deposit the seeds of fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
shrubs or trees; every high tide, and still more every
gale, adds something to the bank; the form of an island
is by degrees assumed; and, last of all, comes man to
take possession.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE BUSH IN THE INTERIOR.</strong></p>


<p>It needs only a single glance at the map of New Holland
to see that, like most other countries, and even
more than most others, the coasts are well known, while
the interior parts are comparatively undiscovered, and,
to a great extent, totally so. And, although a much more
minute description of the shores of this immense island
might easily be given, although we might accompany
Flinders or King in their navigation of its intricate seas,
and survey of its long line of coast, yet this part of the
subject must necessarily be passed over without detaining
us any further. A very considerable portion of the
sea-coast of New Holland is not much unlike that in the
Gulph of Carpentaria, in the north part of the island,
where, when Captain Flinders had reached the highest
spot he could find in 175 leagues of coast,&mdash;this loftiest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
hill did not much exceed the height of the ship&#8217;s masthead!
And where the shores are not of this exceedingly
level character, they are usually sterile, sandy, and broken,
so as to offer rather an uninviting aspect to the stranger.
It is obvious that, in either case, whether the coast be
flat or barren, there may be many beautiful and lovely
districts within a day&#8217;s journey inland; and nothing is
more absurd than to take exception against the whole
of a country merely because its borders and boundaries
are forbidding. In the case of New Holland, it is true,
the same sort of barrenness extends itself very much
into the interior of the land; but, if we pursue the
patient footsteps and daring discoveries of those few
Europeans who have penetrated far into its inland
parts, we shall find many interesting scenes described,
and much both of the sublime and beautiful in nature
brought before us.</p>

<p>One of the principal scenes on which have been displayed
the perseverance and courage of the explorers of
the interior is the banks of the river Darling. This
stream, which has its source on the western side of the
long range of mountains running parallel with the coast,
and called in the colony the Blue Mountains, carries off
the drainage of an immense extent of country, to the
westward and north-westward of New South Wales.
In fact, except in the southern parts of that colony,
where the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee carry off the
waters which do not fall eastwards to the coast, all the
streams that rise upon or beyond the Blue Mountains,
and take a westerly direction, finally meet together in
the basin of the Darling.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It might be imagined that a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
river into which is carried the drainage of so extensive a
district would be always well supplied with water, and
so it would be in other countries, but the streams of
New Holland are altogether different from those in
other parts of the world. Comparatively, indeed, the
Darling does assert its superiority over most of the other
water-courses of that country; for, at a season when
their channels were, in general, absolutely without
water, or dwindled down into mere chains of muddy
ponds, the Darling still continued to wind its slow current,
carrying a supply of excellent water through the
heart of a desert district. Along the weary plains by
which its course is bounded, it proceeds for not less than
660 miles,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> without receiving, so far as is known, a single
tributary stream; and, from its waters being occasionally
salt, it is supposed to owe its support, in its reduced
state during very dry seasons, chiefly to natural springs.
Its bed is, on an average, about sixty feet below the
common surface of the country. There are no traces of
water-courses on the level plains, and it would appear
that, whatever moisture descends from the higher
grounds, which (where there are any at all,) are seldom
less than twelve miles from the Darling, must be taken
up by the clayey soil, so as scarcely to find its way
down to the river, except it be by springs. The average
breadth of the stream at the surface, when low, is about
fifty yards, but oftener less than this, and seldom more.
The fall of the country through which it passes, in that
part of its course through the interior, which was first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
explored by Major Mitchell, is very trifling; and it is
the opinion of that officer, that the swiftness of its
course never exceeds one mile per hour, but that it is in
general much less. At the time of the Major&#8217;s expedition,
the water actually flowing, as seen at one or two
shallow places, did not exceed in quantity that which
would be necessary to turn a mill. But, with all this scantiness
of supply during the dry season then prevailing,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
the marks of tremendous inundations were plain
upon the surface of the country, frequently extending
two miles back from the ordinary channel of the waters.
And everywhere the banks of the river displayed the
effect of floods in parallel lines, marking on the smooth
sloping earth the various heights to which the waters
had at different periods arisen. The surface of the
plains nearest the river is unlike any part of the earth&#8217;s
face that the travellers had elsewhere seen. It was
clear of vegetation, like a fallow-field, but less level, and
quite full of holes, big enough to receive the whole leg,
and sometimes the body, of the unfortunate persons
who might slip into them. Galloping or trotting in such
a country was out of the question, and as the surface of
this dry and cracked soil was soft and loose, it was very
fatiguing for draught. Six of the bullocks accompanying
the expedition never returned from the Darling.
Yet, how much preferable was the country, even in this
state, to that in which a flood would have placed it; for,
had rainy weather, or any overflowing of the river, happened,
travelling upon the banks of the Darling would
have become absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>But the river Darling itself, though it appears as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
principal and independent stream during so long a
course, is, we have little reason to doubt, no more than
an important tributary to the chief of Australian rivers,
the Murray. This last channel collects eventually all
the waters flowing in a westward direction upon the
eastern side of New Holland, between the latitudes of
28&deg; S. and 36&deg; S. The Darling, the Lachlan, and the
Murrumbidgee, without mentioning streams of minor
importance, all find their way southwards into the basin
of the Murray, which is really a noble river, and does
not seem subject to the same deplorable impoverishment,
which most of the others suffer in very dry seasons.
It was very earnestly anticipated that the mouth
of a stream like this would probably form a good harbour,
and thus afford a reasonable prospect of its hereafter
becoming a busy navigable river, the means of
furnishing inland communication to a considerable distance.
This is, of all things, what New Holland appears
most to want, but the want is not (as we shall shortly
find) adequately supplied by the entrance to the Murray.
A like failure occurs at the entrance of other Australian
rivers, as in the instance of a much smaller but very
beautiful stream, the Glenelg, which falls into a shallow
basin within the sandy hills of the southern coast, the
outlet being between two rocky heads, but choked up
with the sands of the beach. We cannot, while we
read of the scanty means of inland navigation, with
which it has pleased Divine Providence to favour an
island so enormous as New Holland, but feel thankful
for the abundant advantages of this kind which our
own native islands possess; but at the same time
there is no reason to despair, even yet, of a navigable
river being discovered in New Holland;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the worst, the modern invention of rail-roads may supersede,
in a great measure, the need of other communication.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to compress into a moderate
compass the various interesting particulars, which have
been related of the rivers of New Holland and their neighbouring
districts; but for this and much other pleasing
information the reader may be referred, once for all, to
the works of those travellers, whose names have been
already so frequently mentioned. It is a curious fact
that almost every stream of the least consequence in
New Holland, appears to have its peculiar features, and
a character and scenery of its own, which continue
throughout its course, so that it could often be recognised
by travellers coming upon it a second time, and
at a different part of its career towards the sea. The
beautifully-timbered plains, or the limestone cliffs of
the noble Murray&mdash;the naked plains that bound on
either side the strip of forest-trees of huge dimensions,
by which the Lachlan is bordered,&mdash;the constantly full
stream, the water-worn and lightly-timbered banks, the
clear open space between the river and its distant
margin of reeds, which mark the character of the
Murrumbidgee,&mdash;the low grassy banks or limestone
rocks, the cascades and caverns, the beautiful festoons
of creeping plants, the curious form of the duck-billed
platypus,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which are to be found on the Glenelg; the
sandstone wastes of the Wollondilly, the grassy surface
of the pretty Yarrayne,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with its trees on its brink
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
instead of on its bank; the peculiar grandeur of the
tremendous ravine, 1,500 feet in depth, down which the
Shoalhaven flows; these and many more remarkable
features of scenery in the Australian rivers, would
afford abundance of materials for description either in
poetry or prose. But we can now notice only one more
peculiarity which most of these streams exhibit; they
have, at a greater or less distance from their proper
channels, secondary banks, beyond which floods rarely
or never are known to extend. In no part of the
habitable world is the force of contrast more to be
observed than in Australia. A very able scientific
writer<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> has ingeniously represented three persons
travelling in certain directions across Great Britain,
and finishing their journeys with three totally different
impressions of the soil, country, and inhabitants; one
having passed through a rocky and mining district, the
second through a coal country peopled by manufacturers,
and a third having crossed a chalky region devoted
entirely to agriculture. An observation of this
kind is even still more true of New Holland. And, consequently,
when, instead of <em>pursuing</em> the course of
certain similar lines of country, the traveller <em>crosses</em>
these, the changes that take place in the appearance
and productions of the various districts are exceedingly
striking and follow sometimes in very rapid succession.
A few examples of these contrasts, which arise in
Australia from the nature of the seasons, as well as
from that of the soil or climate, may here be noticed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
How great a change did the exploring party under
Major Mitchell experience, when, after tracing for forty-nine
days the dry bed of the Lachlan, they suddenly
saw a magnificent stream of clear and running water
before them, and came upon the Murrumbidgee. Its
banks, unlike those of the former channel, were clothed
with excellent grass; a pleasing sight for the cattle&mdash;and
it was no slight satisfaction to their possessors to
see the jaded animals, after thirsting so long among the
muddy holes of the Lachlan, drinking at this full and
flowing stream. And yet, so different are the series of
seasons, at intervals, that, down the very river of which
Mitchell speaks in 1836 as a deep, dry ravine, containing
only a scanty chain of small ponds, the boats of
its first explorer, Mr. Oxley, had, in 1817, floated
during a space of fifteen days, until they had reached
a country almost entirely flooded, and the river seemed
completely to lose itself among the shallow waters!
During the winter of 1835, the whale-boats were drawn
by the exploring party 1,600 miles over land,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> without
finding a river, where they could be used; whereas, in
1817 and 1818, Mr. Oxley had twice retired by nearly
the same routes, and in the same season of the year,
from supposed inland seas!<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> So that, in fact, we rise
from the perusal of two accounts of travellers of credit,
both exploring the very same country, with the impression,
from one statement, that there exists an
endless succession of swamps, or an immense shallow,
inland lake; where, from the other, we are taught to
believe, there is nothing but a sandy desert to be found,
or dry and cracked plains of clay, baked hard by the
heat of the sun.</p>

<p>Changes of this sort in the seasons, affecting so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
powerfully the appearance of whole districts, cannot
but have a proportionable effect on particular spots.
Regent&#8217;s Lake, the &ldquo;noble lake,&rdquo; as its first discoverer,
Oxley, called it, was, when Mitchell visited it, for the
most part, a plain covered with luxuriant grass;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> some
good water, it is true, lodged on the most eastern extremity,
but nowhere to a greater depth than a foot.
There ducks and swans, in vast numbers, had taken
refuge, and pelicans stood high upon their legs above
the remains of Regent&#8217;s Lake. On its northern margin,
and within the former boundary of the lake, stood dead
trees of a full-grown size, which had been apparently
killed by too much water, plainly showing to what long
periods the extremes of drought and moisture have
extended, and may again extend, in this singular
country. And some of the changes in scenery, within
a short distance, and frequently arising from the same
causes, the presence or absence of water, are very
remarkable. In Major Mitchell&#8217;s journal, at the date
of April 10th, may be found the following observations:
&ldquo;We had passed through valleys, on first descending
from the mountains, where the yellow oat-grass resembled
a ripe crop of grain. But this resemblance to
the emblem of plenty, made the desolation of these
hopeless solitudes only the more apparent, abandoned,
as they then were, alike by man, beast, and bird. No
living thing remained in these valleys, for water, that
element so essential to life, was a want too obvious in
the dismal silence, (for not an insect hummed,) and the
yellow hues of withering vegetation.&rdquo; On the next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
page of the journal, under the events of the following
day, what a contrast appears:&mdash;&ldquo;The evening was
beautiful; the new grass springing in places where it
had been burnt, presented a shining verdure in the
rays of the descending sun; the songs of the birds accorded
here with other joyous sounds, the very air
seemed alive with the music of animated nature, so
different was the scene in this well-watered valley, from
that of the parched and silent region from which we
had just descended. The natives, whom we met here,
were fine-looking men, enjoying contentment and happiness,
within the precincts of their native woods.&rdquo; They
were very civil, and presented a burning stick to the
strangers, at the moment when they saw that they
wanted fire, in a manner expressive of welcome and of
a wish to assist them. At a distance were the native
fires, and the squalling of children might be heard, until
at night the beautiful moon came forth, and the soft
notes of a flute belonging to one of the Englishmen fell
agreeably on the ear, while the eye was gratified by
the moonbeams, as they gleamed from the trees, amid
the curling smoke of the temporary encampment. The
cattle were refreshing themselves in green pastures.
It was Saturday night, and next day the party was to
rest. How sweet a spot to repose from their toils and
sufferings, and to lift up their hearts towards the mercy-seat
of Him,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">

<p>One of the greatest victories over natural difficulties
that was ever gained by British courage and perseverance,
was the exploring of the course of the Morrumbidgee
and Murray rivers by Captain Sturt and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
party, in the year 1830; and since their route was
through a new country, and their descent from the
high lands south-westward of Sydney, to the southern
coast of New Holland was an amazing enterprise to project,
much more to accomplish, an abridged account of
it may not be unacceptable to the reader. And when it
is remembered that the sight of the gallant officer commanding
this expedition, was sacrificed almost entirely
to &ldquo;the effect of exposure and anxiety of mind in the
prosecution of geographical researches,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> this fact may
add to the interest which we feel in his adventures.
The Murrumbidgee is a river which runs westerly from
the district called Yass Plains, situated very nearly at
the south-western extremity of New South Wales. It
was for the purpose of exploring the course of this fine
stream, that Captain Sturt was sent out at the latter
end of 1829, and he had reached by land-conveyance a
swampy region exactly resembling those marshes in
which the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers had been supposed
by Mr. Oxley to lose themselves. To proceed
further by land was impossible, and, since they had
brought with them a whale-boat, which had been drawn
by oxen for many a weary mile, it was resolved to
launch this on the river, a smaller boat was built in
seven days only, and both boats being laden with necessaries,
and manned with six hands, arrangements were
made for forming a dep&ocirc;t, and the rest of the party
were sent back; and when the explorers thus parted
company in the marshy plains of the Morrumbidgee, it
appeared doubtful even to themselves whether they
were ever likely to meet again in this world. Of the
country, whither the stream would carry the little crew
of adventurers, literally nothing was known. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
might be a vast inland sea,&mdash;and then how could they
hope with their frail barks to navigate it in safety for the
very first time? Or, even if they did so, how were they
to force their way back again to the remote dwelling-places
of civilised man? The river might gradually
waste itself among the morasses; and then, with their
boats become useless for want of depth of water, how
were they to walk across those endless levels of soft
mud? or, supposing that to be practicable, how were
their provisions to be conveyed, or whence, then, except
from their boats, could they hope for a supply? Questions
of this nature must have offered themselves to
the minds of the daring spirits, who accompanied Captain
Sturt; nor can due justice be rendered to their courage
without a careful consideration of the dangers which
they deliberately braved.</p>

<p>Two oars only were used in the whale-boat, to the
stern of which the skiff was fastened by a rope; but the
progress of the party down the river was rapid. Having
passed, in the midst of the marshes, the mouth of a
considerable stream (supposed to be the Lachlan, here
emptying its waters out from the midst of those swamps
wherein it appeared to Mr. Oxley to be lost,) on the
second day of their journey the voyagers met with
an accident that had nearly compelled them to return.
The skiff struck upon a sunken log, and, immediately
filling, went down in about twelve feet of water. Damage
was done to some of the provisions, and many tools
were thrown overboard, though these were afterwards
regained by means of diving and great labour, and the
skiff was got up again. In the very same night a robbery
was committed by the natives; and a frying-pan,
three cutlasses, and five tomahawks, with the pea of the
steelyards&mdash;altogether no small loss in the Australian
desert&mdash;were carried off. The country in this part is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
&ldquo;a waving expanse of reeds, and as flat as possible,&rdquo;
and the river, instead of increasing in its downward
course, seemed rather to be diminishing. After some
days, however, the party had passed through this flooded
region, and reached a boundless flat, with no object for
the eye to rest upon, beyond the dark and gloomy woods
by which it was occupied. Several rapids occurred in
the river; and, during great part of two days the channel
was so narrow and so much blocked up with huge trees,
that, in spite of every effort, the adventurers were expecting
their boat every moment to strike. For two
hours in the afternoon of the second of these days of
anxiety, the little vessels were hurried rapidly along the
winding reaches of the Morrumbidgee, until suddenly they
found themselves borne upon the bosom of a broad and
noble river, in comparison with which that which they
had just quitted bore the appearance of an insignificant
opening! The width of the large stream thus discovered
was about 350 feet, and its depth from 12 to 20 feet,
whilst its banks, although averaging 18 feet in height,
were evidently subject to floods. The breadth of rich
soil between its outer and inner banks was very inconsiderable,
and the upper levels were poor and sandy.
As the party descended, the adjoining country became
somewhat higher and a little undulating, and natives
were seen, while the Murray (for such was the name
given to their new discovery) improved upon them
every mile they proceeded. Four natives of a tribe with
which they had met followed them, as guides, for some
distance, and, after having nearly lost their largest boat
upon a rock in the midst of a rapid, the British travellers
continued their onward course, and a sail was hoisted
for the first time, in order to save, as much as was possible,
the strength of the men.</p>

<p>The country in this part of their voyage was again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
very low, and they fell in with a large body of savages,
with whom they were on the point of being forced, in
self-defence, to have a deadly encounter, when suddenly
the four natives who had accompanied them appeared
running at full speed, and, through their assistance,
though not without some difficulty, bloodshed was prevented.
Very shortly after this adventure, when the
men had just pushed their boat off from a shoal, upon
which it had struck, they noticed a new and considerable
stream coming from the north, and uniting its
waters with those of the Murray. Upon landing on
the right bank of the newly-discovered stream, the
natives came swimming over from motives of curiosity;
and there were not less than 600 of these, belonging to
some of the most ferocious tribes in Australia, surrounding
eight Englishmen&mdash;Captain Sturt, his friend M&#699;Leay,
and the crew&mdash;which last had been preserved by an
almost miraculous intervention of Providence in their
favour. The boat was afterwards pulled a few miles
up the recently-discovered river, which is reasonably
supposed to have been the Darling, from whose
banks, some hundreds of miles higher up, Captain Sturt
had twice been forced to retire in a former expedition.
Its sides were sloping and grassy, and overhung by magnificent
trees; in breadth it was about 100 yards, and in
depth rather more than twelve feet, and the men pleased
themselves by exclaiming, upon entering it, that they
had got into an English river. A net extending right
across the stream at length checked their progress; for
they were unwilling to disappoint the numbers who
were expecting their food that day from this source.
So the men rested on their oars in the midst of the
smooth current of the Darling, the Union-Jack was
hoisted, and, giving way to their feelings, all stood up
in the boat, and gave three distinct cheers. &ldquo;The eye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of every native along the banks had been fixed upon
that noble flag, at all times a beautiful object,&rdquo; says
Captain Sturt, &ldquo;and to them a novel one, as it waved
over us in the heart of a desert. They had, until that
moment, been particularly loquacious, but the sight
of that flag and the sound of our voices hushed the
tumult; and while they were still lost in astonishment,
the boat&#8217;s head was speedily turned, the sail was
sheeted home, both wind and current were in our
favour, and we vanished from them with a rapidity
that surprised even ourselves, and which precluded every
hope of the most adventurous among them to keep up
with us.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Cheered with the gratification of national feeling thus
powerfully described, the patient crew returned to their
toils in descending the Murray, whose banks continued
unchanged for some distance; but its channel was much
encumbered with timber, some very large sand-banks
were seen, and several rapids were passed. The skiff
being found more troublesome than useful, was broken
up and burned. On one occasion, during a friendly
interview with some of the savages, some clay was piled
up, as a means of inquiring whether there were any hills
near; and two or three of the blacks, catching the meaning,
pointed to the N. W., in which direction two lofty
ranges were seen from the top of a tree, and were supposed
to be not less than 40 miles distant, but the
country through which the Murray passed still continued
low.</p>

<p>The heat was excessive and the weather very dry,
while the banks of the river appeared to be thickly
peopled for Australia, and the British strangers contrived
to keep upon good terms with the natives.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
After having passed one solitary cliff of some height,
they met with stormy weather for a few days, and several
tributary streams of some size were perceived mingling
their waters with those of the Murray, the left bank
of which became extremely lofty, and, though formed
almost wholly of clay and sand, it bore the appearance
of columns or battlements, the sand having been washed
away in many places, while the clay was left hollowed
out more like the work of art than of nature. After a
continued descent of 22 days, the party, who were
pleased with the noble character of the river upon which
they were, though disappointed at the poverty of the
country through which it passed, began to grow somewhat
weary; but upon inquiries being made of the natives
no tidings could be gained respecting their approach
towards the sea. The navigation of every
natural stream is rendered tedious, though beautiful, by
its devious course, but, &ldquo;what with its regular turns,
and its extensive sweeps, the Murray covers treble the
ground, at a moderate computation, that it would occupy
in a direct course.&rdquo; The current became weaker, and
the channel deeper, as they proceeded down the stream,
and the cliffs of clay and sand were succeeded by others
of a very curious formation, being composed of shells
closely compacted together, but having the softer parts
so worn away, that the whole cliff bore in many places
the appearance of human skulls piled one upon the
other. At first, this remarkable formation did not rise
more than a foot above the water, but within ten miles
from this spot it exceeded 150 feet in height, the country
in the vicinity became undulating, and the river itself
was confined in a glen whose extreme breadth did not
exceed half a mile. An old man, a native, was met with
hereabouts, who appeared by his signs to indicate that
the explorers were at no great distance from some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
remarkable change. The old man pointed to the N. W.,
and then placed his hand on the side of his head, in
token, it was supposed, of their sleeping to the N. W.
of the spot where they were. He then pointed due south,
describing by his action, the roaring of the sea, and the
height of the waves. A line of cliffs, from two to three
hundred feet in height, flanked the river upon alternate
sides, but the rest of the country was level, and the soil
upon the table-land at the top of the cliffs very poor and
sterile. The next change of scenery brought them to
cliffs of a higher description, which continued on both
sides of the river, though not always close to it. The
stream lost its sandy bed and its current together, and
became deep, still, and turbid, with a muddy bottom;
and the appearance of the water lashing against the
base of the cliffs reminded the anxious voyagers of the
sea. The scenery became in many places beautiful, and
the river was never less than 400 yards in breadth.
Some sea-gulls were seen flying over the boat, and being
hailed as the messengers of good tidings, they were
not permitted to be shot. The adverse wind and the
short, heavy waves rendered the labour at the oar very
laborious, but the hope of speedily gaining some noble
inlet&mdash;a harbour worthy to form the mouth of a stream
like the Murray&mdash;encouraged the crew to pull on manfully,
and to disregard fatigue. The salt meat was all
spoiled, and had been given to the dogs; fish no one
would eat, and of wild fowl there was none to be seen;
so that the provisions of the party consisted of little
else but flour. And already, though hitherto they had
been performing the easiest part of their task, having
had the stream in their favour, it was evident that the
men were much reduced, besides which they were complaining
of sore eyes.</p>

<p>These circumstances all combined to increase the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
natural anxiety felt by the little band of adventurers to
reach the termination of the Murray; and as its valley
opened to two, three, and four miles of breadth, while
the width of the river increased to the third of a mile, the
expectations of the men toiling at the oar became proportionably
excited. The cliffs ceased, and gave place
to undulating hills; no pleasure-ground could have been
more tastefully laid out than the country to the right,
and the various groups of trees, disposed upon the sides
of the elevations that bounded the western side of the
valley, were most ornamental. On the opposite side,
the country was less inviting, and the hills were bleak
and bare. At length a clear horizon appeared to the
south, the direction in which the river was flowing;
Captain Sturt landed to survey the country, and
beneath him was the great object of his search, the
termination of one of Australia&#8217;s longest and largest
streams. Immediately below him was a beautiful lake,
of very large extent, and greatly agitated by the wind.
Ranges of hills were observed to the westward, stretching
from north to south, and distant forty miles. Between
these hills and the place where the traveller stood,
the western bank of the Murray was continued in the
form of a beautiful promontory projecting into the lake,
and between this point and the base of the ranges the
vast sheet of water before him extended in the shape of
a bay. The scene was altogether a very fine one; but
disappointment was a prevailing feeling in the mind of
the explorer, for it was most likely that there would be
no practicable communication for large ships between
the lake and the ocean, and thus a check was put
upon the hopes that had been entertained of having
at length discovered a large and navigable river leading
into the interior of New Holland. The lake, called
Lake Alexandrina, which was fifty miles long and forty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
broad,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was crossed with the assistance of a favourable
wind; its waters were found to be generally very shallow,
and the long, narrow, and winding channel by which it
communicates with the ocean was found, as it had been
feared, almost impracticable even for the smallest vessels.
This channel unites itself with the sea on the
south-western coast of New Holland, at the bottom of a
bay named Encounter Bay, one boundary of which is
Cape Jervis, by which it is separated from St. Vincent&#8217;s
Gulph,&mdash;the very part of the coast where a ship was to
be despatched by the Governor of New South Wales to
afford the party assistance, in case of their being successful
in penetrating to the sea-shore. Flour and tea
were the only articles remaining of their store of provisions,
and neither of these were in sufficient quantities
to last them to the place where they expected to find
fresh supplies inland. But the first view of Encounter
Bay convinced them that no vessel could ever venture
into it at a season when the S. W. winds prevailed, and
to the deep bight which it formed upon the coast (at the
bottom of which they then were), it was hopeless to
expect any vessel to approach so nearly as to be seen by
them. To remain there was out of the question; to cross
the ranges towards the Gulph of St. Vincent, when the
men had no strength to walk, and the natives were numerous
and not peaceably disposed, was equally impossible.
The passage from the lake to the ocean was not without
interruption, from the shallowness of the sandy channel,
otherwise Captain Sturt, in his little boat, would have
coasted round to Port Jackson, or steered for Launceston,
in Van Dieman&#8217;s Land; and this he declares he would
rather have done, could he have foreseen future difficulties,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
than follow the course which he did. Having
walked across to the entrance of the channel, and found
it quite impracticable and useless, he resolved to return
along the same route by which he had come, only with
these important additional difficulties to encounter,&mdash;diminished
strength, exhausted stores, and an adverse
current. The provisions were found sufficient only for
the same number of days upon their return as they had
occupied in descending the river, and speed was no less
desirable in order to avoid encounters with the natives
than for the purpose of escaping the miseries of want;
into which, however, it was felt, a single untoward accident
might in an instant plunge them. With feelings
of this description the party left Lake Alexandrina and
re-entered the channel of the Murray.</p>

<p>It will be needless to follow the explorers through all
the particulars of their journey upwards to the dep&ocirc;t
on the Morrumbidgee. The boat struck, the natives
were troublesome, the rapids difficult to get over; but
the worst of all their toils and trials were their daily
labours and unsatisfied wants. One circumstance ought,
in justice to the character of the men, to be noticed.
They positively refused to touch six pounds of sugar
that were still remaining in the cask, declaring that, if
divided, it would benefit nobody, whereas it would last
during some time for the use of Captain Sturt and Mr.
M&#699;Leay, who were less able to submit to privations than
they were. After having continued for no less than
fifty-five days upon the waters of the Murray, it was
with great joy that they quitted this stream, and turned
their boat into the gloomy and narrow channel of the
Morrumbidgee. Having suffered much privation, anxiety,
and labour, and not without one or two unpleasant
encounters with the natives, at length the party reached
their dep&ocirc;t, but they found it deserted! During seventy-seven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
days they could not have pulled, according to
Captain Sturt&#8217;s calculation, less than 2000 miles; and
now, worn out by fatigue and want, they were compelled
to proceed yet further, and to endure, for some
time longer, the most severe privations to which man
can be exposed. But, under the guidance of Divine
Providence, the lives of all were preserved, and now
the reward of their deeds of heroism is willingly bestowed
upon them. Among the boldest exploits ever performed
by man, the descent of Captain Sturt and his companions
down the Murray, and their return to the same spot
again, may deserve to be justly ranked.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Nor, however
disappointing the result of their examination of the
mouth of the Murray may have been, was their daring
adventure without its useful consequences. The lake
Alexandrina is said to be navigable across for vessels
drawing six feet of water, and the entrance to the sea,
though rather difficult in heavy weather, is safe in moderate
weather for vessels of the same size. The Murray
itself is navigable for steam-vessels for many hundred
miles, and probably it will not be very long before
these modern inventions are introduced upon its
waters.</p>

<p>Whoever has seen any recent map of New Holland
must have been struck with the curious appearance of
a vast semicircle of water, called Lake Torrens, near
the southern coast, and extending many miles inland
from the head of Spencer&#8217;s Gulph. A range of hills,
named Flinders&#8217; Range, runs to a considerable distance
inland, taking its rise near the head of the gulph just
mentioned, and Lake Torrens nearly surrounds the
whole of the low country extending from this mountainous
ridge. This immense lake is supposed to resemble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
in shape a horse-shoe, and to extend for full
400 miles, whilst its apparent breadth is from 20 to 30.
The greater part of the vast area contained in its bed is
certainly dry on the surface, and consists of a mixture of
sand and mud, of so soft and yielding a character as to
render perfectly unavailing all attempts either to cross
it, or to reach the edge of the water, which appears to
exist at a distance of some miles from the outer margin.
Once only was Mr. Eyre, the enterprising discoverer of
this singular lake, able to taste of its waters, and then
he found them as salt as the sea. The low, miserable,
desert country in the neighbourhood, and Lake Torrens
itself, act as a kind of barrier against the progress of
inland discovery at the back of the colony of South
Australia, since it is impossible to penetrate very far
into the interior, without making a great circle either
to the east or to the west. The portion of the bed of
the lake which is exposed is thickly coated with particles
of salt; there are few trees or shrubs of any kind to be
found near, nor are grass and fresh water by any means
abundant. Altogether, the neighbourhood of Lake
Torrens would seem a very miserable region, and forms
a strong contrast to the smiling and cultivated district
of which it forms the back country.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Although Australia, in its natural and uncultivated
state, abounds in trees, like most other wild countries,
nevertheless, there are vast and extensive tracts where
the plains are entirely bare, or covered only with a low,
thick, and often prickly, bush, or else are what is termed
&ldquo;open forest,&rdquo; that is, are dotted about with fine trees,
dispersed in various groups, and resembling the scenery
of an English park. The greatest peculiarity of the
native forests appears to be, that the whole of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
trees and shrubs are evergreen,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> although European
trees will flourish in the land of the south without acquiring
this peculiarity, or losing their deciduous character.
But it is rather a subject of complaint against
the woods of New Holland, that they have very little
picturesque effect in them, which may be partly owing
to the poverty of the foliage of the prevailing tree, the
<em>eucalyptus</em>, (commonly called the <em>iron-bark</em>, or <em>blue gum</em>,
according to its species,) which seldom has anything
ornamental to landscape, either in the trunk or branches.
These sombre trees are, however, very useful for timber,
and they grow to an astonishing height, often rearing
up their lofty heads to 150 feet or upwards. The woods,
in general, are very brittle, partly, it may be, owing to
the number of acacias which are to be found among
them; and no experienced bushman likes to sleep under
trees, especially during high winds. We must by no
means form our ideas of the appearance of an Australian
forest from that of the neat and trim woods of
our own country, where every single branch or bough,
and much more every tree, bears a certain value. Except
that portion which is required for fuel or materials
by an extremely scattered population in a very mild
climate, there is nothing carried off from the forests, and,
were it not for the frequent and destructive fires which
the natives kindle in many parts, no check worth mentioning
would be placed upon the natural increase and
decay of the woods of New Holland. The consequence
of this is, that trees are to be seen there in every stage
of growth or ruin; and, occasionally, in very thickly-planted
spots, the surface of the ground is not a little
encumbered by the fallen branches and trunks of the
ancient ornaments of the forest. Nor is it by the hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of Time alone that these marks of destruction are scattered
about in the vast woodlands; the breath of a
tremendous storm will occasionally accomplish, perhaps,
as much in a few hours as natural decay would in many
years.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Altogether, the forests of Australia may be
said to be in a purely natural state, and thus do they
offer to the eye of the inquiring traveller many objects
less pleasing, it may be, but nevertheless more sublime
and solemn, than those with which the woods of more
cultivated countries commonly abound.</p>

<p>To travel without any beaten track through a country
clothed, in many parts, very thickly, by forests like those
just described, is in itself no easy undertaking, and the
operation of hewing a way for a mile or two through
the surrounding woods, during the very heat of the day,
and sometimes after a long march, is very trying. But
when the exposure to burning thirst, and to the uncertain
disposition of the native inhabitants is added, the
patient endurance of successful explorers is still more
strongly displayed. Nor, although it be only a minor
annoyance, must the pain and inconvenience felt by
wanderers in the bush from the prickly grass, which
is found abundantly in the sandy districts, be forgotten.
In those barren sands, where no grass grows, there are
frequently tufts of a prickly bush, which tortures the
horses, and tears to pieces the clothes of the men about
their ankles, if they are walking. This bush, called the
prickly grass, and a dwarf tree, the <em>Eucalyptus dumosa</em>,
grows only where the soil appears too barren and loose
for anything else; indeed, were it not for these, the
sand would probably drift away, and cover the vegetation
of neighbouring spots less barren and miserable.
Against this evil, nature seems to have provided by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
presence of two plants so singularly fitted for a soil of
this description. The root of the <em>Eucalyptus dumosa</em>
resembles that of a large tree; but it has no trunk, and
only a few branches rise above the ground, forming an
open kind of bush, often so low that a man on horseback
may look over it for miles. This dwarf tree, and the
prickly grass together, occupy the ground, and seem
intended to bind down the sands of Australia. The size
of the roots prevents the bush from growing very close
together, and the stems being without leaves, except at
the top, this kind of <em>Eucalyptus</em> is almost proof against
the running fires of the bush. The prickly grass
resembles, at a distance, in colour and form, an overgrown
lavender plant, but the blades of it, consisting of
sharp spikes, occasion most cruel annoyance both to
men and horses. Another inconvenience and danger
to which exploring parties are liable, are those fires in
the bush already alluded to; which, whether caused by
accident, or designedly by the natives, are not uncommon
events.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> &ldquo;The country seemed all on fire around us.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All
the country beyond the river was in flames; one
spark might have set the whole country on our side in a
blaze, and then no food would remain for the cattle,
not to mention the danger to our stores and ammunition.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fires prevailed extensively at great distances in the
interior, and the sultry air seemed heated by the general
conflagration;&rdquo; these expressions convey rather alarming
ideas of the dangers to which travellers are exposed
in the bush, and from which it is not always easy to
make good an escape.</p>

<p>It may have been observed, possibly, in what has
been related of the country and scenery of New Holland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in its natural state, that the descriptions of very beautiful
or fertile spots have been comparatively few. Now,
although it is true that a very large portion of the
known surface of that island is occupied by the sandstone
rock, which is in its very nature utterly barren,
nevertheless, it is by no means to be supposed that
there is any scarcity of most rich and beautiful land&mdash;some
of it fit for immediate occupation&mdash;to be found in
most parts of Australia. In attempting to draw a
picture of a distant and remarkable region, we are almost
sure to mark and bring distinctly out its most peculiar
and striking features; the scenes resembling those of
our own quiet and happy land are passed over as tame
and familiar, while the dreariness of the desert, the
horrors of a &ldquo;barren and dry land where no water is,&rdquo;&mdash;the
boundless plains, or the bare mountain-tops, the
lonely shore or the rocky isle&mdash;scenes like these, are
commonly dwelt upon and described. In short, the
very spots which are least enticing, <em>in reality</em>, for the
colonist to settle in, are often most agreeable, <em>in description</em>,
for the stranger to read of.</p>

<p>But, since the reader must not be left with the erroneous
and unpleasant impression that the country of
which we have been treating is, for the most part, a mere
wilderness, if not a desert, we may select two recently-discovered
districts of it to serve for a favourable
specimen of the beauty and fertility of many others,
which cannot now be noticed.</p>

<p>The following description of Wellington Valley (now
recently included in the limits of the colony,) is from
the pen of its first discoverer, Mr. Oxley, and other
travellers bear witness that it is not overcharged: &ldquo;A
mile and a half brought us into the valley which we had
seen on our first descending into the glen: imagination
cannot fancy anything more beautifully picturesque than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the scene which burst upon us. The breadth of the
valley, to the base of the opposite gently-rising hills, was
between three and four miles, studded with fine trees,
upon a soil which for richness can nowhere be exceeded;
its extent, north and south, we could not see: to the
west, it was bounded by the lofty rocky ranges by which
we had entered it; these were covered to the summit
with cypresses and acacias in full bloom, and a few trees
in bright green foliage gave additional beauty to the scene.
In the centre of this charming valley ran a strong and
beautiful stream, its bright, transparent waters dashing
over a gravelly bottom, intermingled with large stones,
forming at short intervals considerable pools, in which
the rays of the sun were reflected with a brilliancy equal
to that of the most polished mirror. The banks were
low and grassy, with a margin of gravel and pebble-stones;
there were marks of flood to the height of about
twelve feet, when the river would still be confined within
its secondary banks, and not overflow the rich lands that
bordered it. Its usual width is 200 feet; in times of
flood it would be from 600 to 800 feet.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In Australia Felix, as it has been called by its discoverer,
Major Mitchell, which is a much larger district
than that just described, almost every earthly delight
and advantage would likewise seem to have combined to
make it a perfect dwelling-place for man. The temperate
and mild climate; the neighbourhood of the sea; the
variety and fertility of its surface; the ranges of lofty and
picturesque mountains by which it is backed; the number
of rivers, small and large, by which it is watered; the
comparatively open nature of the country, yet not without
an ample supply of timber close at hand; all these
and other advantages unite in rendering Australia Felix
one of the most desirable spots upon the face of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
globe. And the beauties and blessings of a spot like
this, must have stood forth in bold contrast with the
dreary, lifeless plains of the Darling, or Lachlan, which
the discoverers of Australia Felix had so long been
engaged in exploring. One of the first harbingers of
the better country, to which the travellers were drawing
near, was a very curious height, called Pyramid Hill,
which is formed of granite, and, being a triangular
pyramid, standing quite alone, closely resembles the
monuments of ancient Egypt. It rises 300 feet above
the surrounding plain; its point consists of a single
block of granite, and the view over the neighbouring
country was exceedingly beautiful. The scene was
different from anything the travellers had elsewhere
witnessed. &ldquo;A land so inviting, and still without
inhabitants!<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
As I stood,&rdquo; continues the explorer,
warming with the thoughts of his discovery, &ldquo;the first
European intruder on the sublime solitude of these
verdant plains, as yet untouched by flocks or herds,
I felt conscious of being the harbinger of mighty changes;
and that our steps would soon be followed by the men
and animals for which it seemed to have been prepared.&rdquo;
Twelve days afterwards, the whole of which had been
spent in traversing a district rich and lovely in the
extreme, the first view of a noble range of mountains
(the Grampians) was obtained; they rose in the south
to a stupendous height, and presented as bold and
picturesque an outline as ever painter imagined.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And,
during a journey of many days, the same rich and
sublime scenery still appeared, mingled together in
beautiful and endless variety. Every day the party of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
travellers passed over land which, for natural fertility
and beauty, could scarcely be surpassed; over streams
of unfailing abundance, and plains covered with the
richest pasturage. Stately trees and majestic mountains
adorned the ever-varying landscape, the most southern
region of all Australia, and the best. On the river
Glenelg, which was discovered about a month after they
had left Pyramid Hill, the land appeared everywhere
alike good, alike beautiful; whether on the finely-varied
hills, or in the equally romantic vales, which opened in
endless succession on both banks of the river. Further
on in this lovely district, the British explorers came
upon fresh scenes of surpassing sweetness. A small
party of them were out upon an excursion, when they
perceived before them a ridge in the blue distance&mdash;rather
an unusual object in that close country. They soon
after quitted the wood through which they had been
passing, and found that they were on a kind of table-land,
approaching a deep ravine coming from their right,
which terminated on a very fine-looking open country
below, watered by a winding river. They descended by
a bold projection to the bottom of the ravine, and found
there a foaming little river, hurrying downwards over
rocks. After fording this stream, they ascended a very
steep but grassy mountain-side, and, on reaching a brow
of high land, a noble prospect appeared; a river winding
among meadows that were fully a mile broad, and green
as an emerald. Above them rose swelling hills of
fantastic shapes, but all smooth and thickly covered
with rich verdure. Behind these were higher hills, all
having grass on their sides, and trees on their summits,
and extending east and west throughout the landscaper
as far as could be seen. After riding about two miles
along an entirely open, grassy ridge, the party again
found the Glenelg, flowing eastward towards an apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
much lower country. The river was making for
the coast, (turning southward some miles below the hill
on which they stood,) through a country far surpassing
in beauty and richness any part hitherto discovered.</p>

<p>What, in fact, is there wanting to the charming and
extensive region just described, or what to hundreds of
other fruitful and lovely districts under the power of
the British crown, except <em>civilised inhabitants</em>, and the
establishment of <em>a branch of Christ&#8217;s &ldquo;one Catholic and
Apostolic Church</em>?&rdquo; The population is ready, nay, even
redundant, in England; nor are the means deficient in a
land abounding beyond all others in wealthy capitalists.
But the will, the wisdom, the understanding heart, the
united counsels, are, it is to be feared, and are likely
still to be, wanting with us. May that God who maketh
men to be of one mind in a house or nation, so
dispose events, that in due time the valleys and hills of
Australia Felix may be dotted with churches, and filled
with faithful members of Christ! Then will it become a
<em>happy</em> land indeed. Then may its inhabitants feel a
lively interest, both in the <em>social</em> and <em>religious</em> welfare of
their country; and each one may join, from the distant
shores of the once unknown Southern Land, in the holy
aspirations of the Royal Prophet: &ldquo;For my brethren
and companions&#8217; sakes I will wish thee prosperity. Yea,
because of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek
to do thee good.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>NATIVES OF THE BUSH.</strong></p>


<p>In most instances in which a country is taken possession
of, and its original inhabitants are removed,
enslaved, or exterminated, the party thus violently
seizing upon the rights of others is considered the
superior and more civilized nation of the two. The
very means by which this advantage is gained are,
usually, boldness, and worldly talent, without which
a conquest or successful invasion is impossible; and
these, when prosperous, are qualities which awaken very
powerfully the admiration and attention of men. So
that, while earthly prosperity and excellence are combining
to cast a splendour around the actions of the
successful nation, adversity and inferiority do usually join
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in blackening the cloud which hangs over the character of
that which is unfortunate. It is not for us to defend these
judgments of the world, as though they were, in any case,
altogether righteous judgments, but this we may safely
affirm, in the particular instance of Australia, that, upon
the whole, it is a gain to the cause of truth and virtue
for Christian England to possess those wilds, which
lately were occupied by miserable natives; and, while we
own that it is wrong to do evil that good may come, yet
may we, likewise, confess with thankfulness the Divine
mercy and wisdom which have so often brought good
out of the evil committed by our countrymen in these
distant lands. It must be confessed, too, that, whatever
may be the amount of iniquity wantonly committed
among the natives of the other portions of
the globe, for which Europe is responsible, still, the
Europeans, upon the whole, stand higher than the
inhabitants of the remaining portions, and, of course, in
proportion, very much higher than the most degraded
and least-improved race of savages, the Australian natives.
True, indeed, these despised Australians may,
hereafter, rise up in judgment against Europeans to
condemn them; and when that which has been given to
each race of men shall be again required of them, those
that have received the most may frequently be found to
have profited the least by the gifts of Divine Providence.
Still, without pretending to pass judgment upon any,
whether nations or individual persons,&mdash;without affecting,
either, to close our eyes against the miserable vices
by which the Christian name has been disgraced, and
our country&#8217;s glory sullied, among distant and barbarous
nations, we may with safety speak of the inhabitants of
those heathen lands in terms that are suitable to their
degraded state. In describing their darkened and almost
brutal condition, we are but describing things as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
really exist;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> it changes not the actual fact to prove that,
in many more respects than would at first sight appear,
the behaviour of men of our own <em>enlightened</em> nation is
scarcely less darkened or less brutal than theirs. Nay,
the Australian savage, in his natural state, may be a far
higher and nobler character than the British convict
sometimes is in his degraded state; and, nevertheless, it
may be correct to class the nation of the former among
barbarians, and that of the latter among civilized people.
But in forming our judgment respecting the real character
of the natives of the Bush we must beware lest we
try them by our own standard,&mdash;a standard by which it
is unjust to measure them, since they have never known
it, nor ever had the means of reaching it.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Every wise
man will make all possible allowance for the effect of
many generations of ignorance and degradation upon
the human soul, and when this has been fairly done, the
truly wise man, the humble Christian, whilst he reads of
the deplorable condition to which the human soul may
be reduced, (as it is shown in the instance before us,)
will feel disposed to ask himself, &ldquo;Who made thee to
differ from others? And what hast thou that thou didst
not receive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The native population of Australia is very peculiar in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
many respects, not exactly resembling any other known
race of human beings in the world. They are more
nearly akin to the Africans than to any others, and they
have, accordingly, been sometimes called <em>the Eastern
Negroes</em>, having the same thick lips, high cheek-bones,
sunken eyes, and legs without calves, which distinguish
the native of Africa; but, with the exception of Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land, and the adjoining coasts, the woolly hair
of the negro is not to be found among them, nor is the
nose usually so flat, or the forehead so low. They are
seldom very tall, but generally well made; and their
bodily activity is most surprising; nor is their courage
at all to be despised. The Australian native has always
been pointed out as being the lowest specimen of human
nature, and, since, in every scale of degrees, one must be
lowest, this is probably correct enough; yet we are by
no means to give too hasty credit to the accounts of
their condition, which have been given by those whose
interest it may have been to represent them in as
unfavourable a light as possible, or whose opportunities
of judging have been few and scanty, compared with
their hasty willingness to pass judgment upon them.
Men, more or less busily engaged in killing and taking
possession, are not likely to make a very favourable
report of those poor creatures into whose inheritance
they have come; mere self-defence would tempt them to
try to lessen the greatness of their crimes, by asserting
the victims of these to be scarcely deserving of a better
fate, and, in the present instance, the actual condition of
the native population would be very favourable to excuses
of this kind. Or, even without this evil intention
of excusing wrong by slandering those that suffer it,
many men, with but few means of understanding their
character, may have spoken decidedly respecting the
Australian natives, and that, too, in language even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
harsher than their degraded state would justify. Disgusting
and horrid many of their habits and customs
undoubtedly are, yet they appear even more so at first
sight, and to one only imperfectly acquainted with them;
especially when (which often happens) not the slightest
allowance is made for the peculiar situation of the
savage, but he is taken at once from the midst of his naked
barbarity, and tried by the rules of refinement and civilization.
Recently, indeed, public attention and pity
have been more turned towards the unhappy race of
natives, and many traits have been discovered in their
character which would not dishonour more enlightened
nations. The degraded position of those who are in the
midst of the white population affords no just criterion
of their merits. Their quickness of apprehension is
often surprising, and nothing, however new and strange,
seems to puzzle or astonish them; so that they follow
closely the advice of the ancient poet:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Wonder at nought:&mdash;the only rule I know</span><br />
 To make man happy, and to keep him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are never awkward,&rdquo; says Major Mitchell, who
was well qualified to speak from experience; &ldquo;on the
contrary, in manners, and general intelligence, they
appear superior to any class of white rustics that I have
seen. Their powers of mimicry seem extraordinary,
and their shrewdness shines even through the medium
of imperfect language, and renders them, in general,
very agreeable companions.&rdquo; We may, therefore, if our
inquiry be accompanied by humility and justice, be able to
form a fair and impartial opinion respecting these people;
and the result of an inquiry of this sort must be, in every
well-regulated soul, not merely a feeling of thankfulness
(still less of self-sufficiency,) that we are far removed from
the savage state, but, likewise, a sense of shame, that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
with many of our fellow-countrymen, their superior advantages
have been productive of little or no fruit.</p>

<p>One very remarkable distinction of the natives of the
Bush is, the entire absence of clothing, unless the cloak,
made of opossum-skin, worn by some tribes, can deserve
to be thought an exception. Their climate being, generally
speaking, a dry one, and exposure to the air, even
at night, being much less hurtful than in most other
countries, this habit of going without clothing, after the
fashion of a brute beast, is by no means so dangerous
in Australia as it would be elsewhere. But, while they
can dispense with <em>clothes</em>, like most other savages, they
are extremely fond of <em>ornaments</em>,&mdash;at least, of what they
esteem to be such: these are teeth of kangaroos, or men,
jaw-bones of a fish, feathers, tails of dogs, pieces of
wood, &amp;c., fastened on different parts of the head, by a
sort of gum; while scars, and marks of various kinds,
are made upon the breast, arms, and back; or, upon
certain occasions, as going to war, or mourning for a
friend, the body is streaked over with white and yellow
paint, according to the taste of the party concerned. In
two very distant parts of Australia, namely, the gulf of
Carpentaria, and the eastern coast of St. Vincent&#8217;s Gulf,
the natives practise the rite of circumcision&mdash;a remarkable
agreement, when we consider that they are about
1200 miles apart, and have no means of communication
with each other. It is no uncommon custom, either, for
the natives to pierce their noses, and to place a bone or
reed through the opening, which is reckoned a great
ornament. But there is another custom, almost peculiar
to Australia, which, from its singularity, may deserve
to be noticed at some length. Among many of
the native tribes,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> it is usual for the males to have a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
front tooth, or sometimes <em>two</em>, struck out at the time of
their arriving at manhood, and this ceremony is performed
in a most solemn and impressive manner. The
following account of it, from the pen of an eye-witness,
may be not unacceptable to the reader: Lieutenant
Collins, the historian of the infant colony of New South
Wales, was present during the whole of this curious
operation, and thus describes the accompanying ceremonies
practised by the natives of that part of Australia:&mdash;For
seven days previous to the commencement of the
solemnity, the people continued to assemble, and the
evenings were spent in dancing, for which they adorned
themselves in their best manner, namely, by painting
themselves white, and especially by drawing white circles
round their eyes. When the field was prepared,
and the youths who were to be enrolled among men
were all placed together upon one side of it, the business
began with a loud shout, and a clattering of shields and
spears, from the armed party, whose office it was to
seize the patients about to undergo the extraordinary
operation. This was done one by one, until the whole
number, fifteen, were brought forward, and placed in
the midst of the armed body of men; then each youth
was made to sit down, holding his head downwards,
with his hands clasped, and his legs crossed under him,
in which painful posture it was said they were to remain
all night, without looking up or taking any refreshment
whatever.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The Carrahdis, or persons who were to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
perform the operation, now began some of their strange
mummeries. Each one of these, in his turn, appeared
to suffer most extreme agony, and put himself into
every posture that pain could occasion, until, at length,
a bone was brought forward, which was intended to be
used in the ensuing ceremony; and the poor youths
were led to believe that the more pain these Carrahdis
suffered in obtaining the bone, the less would be theirs
in losing a tooth. The following day began with the
ceremony of the fifteen operators running round upon
their hands and feet, in imitation of the dogs of that
country, and throwing upon the boys, as they passed,
sand and dirt with their hands and feet. The youths
were perfectly still and silent, and it was understood
that this ceremony gave them power over the dog, and
endowed them with whatever good qualities that animal
might possess.</p>

<p>The next part that was performed, was the offering
of a sham kangaroo, made of grass, to the fifteen lads,
who were still seated as before. One man brought the
kangaroo, and a second carried some brushwood, besides
having one or two flowering shrubs stuck through
his nose, and both seemed to stagger under the weight
of their burdens. Stalking and limping, they at last
reached the feet of the youthful hunters, and placed before
them the prize of the chase, after which they went
away, as though entirely wearied out. By this rite was
given the power of killing the kangaroo, and the brushwood,
most likely, was meant to represent its common
haunt. In about an hour&#8217;s space, the chief actors returned
from a valley to which they had retired, bringing
with them long tails of grass, which were fitted to the
girdle. By the help of this addition, they imitated a
herd of kangaroos, one man beating time to them with
a club on a shield, and two others, armed, followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
them and affected to steal unnoticed upon them to spear
them. As soon as these pretended kangaroos had
passed the objects of their visit, they instantly got rid
of their artificial tails, each man caught up a lad, and,
placing him upon his shoulders, carried him off in
triumph to the last scene of this strange exhibition.</p>

<p>After walking a short distance, the men put down
their burdens, placing them in a cluster, each boy with
his head upon his breast, and his hands clasped together.
In a few minutes, after a greater degree of mystery and
preparation than had been before observed, the youthful
band was brought forward to a place where a number
of human beings were seen lying with their faces to
the ground, as if they were dead, and in front of these
was a man seated on a stump of a tree, bearing another
man upon his shoulders, both having their arms extended,
while two men, in a like attitude, were seen
also behind the group of prostrate figures. These first
two men made most hideous faces for a few minutes,
and then the lads were led over the bodies lying on the
ground, which moved and writhed, as though in great
agony; after which the same strange grimaces were
repeated by the two men who were placed on the
further side of the apparently dead bodies. All the
information that could be gained of the meaning of this,
was, that it would make them brave men; that they
would see well and fight well. Then followed a sort of
martial exercise with spear and shield, in the presence
of the future warriors, to signify to them what was to
be one great business of their lives&mdash;the use of the spear;
and, when this was finished, the preparations for striking
out the tooth commenced. The first subject of this
barbarous operation was chosen, and seated upon the
shoulders of a native, who himself sat down upon the
grass; and then the bone was produced, which had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
cost so much apparent pain to procure the evening before,
and which was made very sharp and fine at one
end, for the purpose of lancing the gum. But for some
such precaution, it would have been impossible to have
knocked out the tooth, without breaking the jaw-bone.
A stick was then cut with much ceremony out of some
hard wood, and when the gum of the patient was properly
prepared, the smallest end of the stick was applied
to the top of the tooth, while the operator stood ready
with a large stone, as though about to drive the tooth
down the throat of the youth. Here a certain attention
to the number three, which had been before shown, was
again noticed, for no stroke was actually made, until
three attempts to hit the stick had taken place; and,
notwithstanding repeated blows, so firmly was the
tooth of the first boy fixed in his gum, that it was full
ten minutes before it was forced out. The sufferer
was then removed, his gum was closed, and he was
dressed out in a new style, with a girdle, in which was
stuck a wooden sword, and with a bandage round his
head, while his left hand was placed over his mouth,
and he was not allowed to speak, nor, during that day,
to eat. In this manner were all the others treated,
except one only, who could not endure the pain of
more than one blow with the stone, and, breaking away
from his tormentors, he managed to make his escape.
During the whole operation a hideous noise was kept
up around the patients, with whom, generally, it seemed
to be a point of honour to endure this pain without a
single murmur. Having once gone through this strange
ceremony, they were henceforth admitted into the
company and privileges of the class of men.</p>

<p>And as the commencement of manhood in this way,
requires no small exercise of courage and endurance of
pain, so the remainder of the life of an Australian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
savage is usually abundant in trials calling for the like
qualities, and demanding both bravery and patience.
Whatever may be the particular evils of civilized society,
and however some wild imaginations may be tempted
by these to regard with regret or envy the enjoyments
of savage life, after all it must be confessed,
these enjoyments are, at best, very scanty and very
uncertain, whilst the miseries attendant upon such a
state are of a nature continually to try the patience
and weary the spirit of him who has to endure them.
Without dwelling just at present upon the natural wants
and sufferings to which savage men are perpetually exposed
in the wilderness of Australia, it is deplorable to
think of how many evils these thinly-scattered tribes
are the cause to each other; enormous and sad is the
amount of suffering, which, even in those lonely and
unfrequented regions, human beings are constantly
bringing upon their brethren or neighbours. War,
which seems almost a necessary evil, an unavoidable
scourge to man&#8217;s fallen race, in all ages and in every
country, wears its most deadly aspect, and shows its
fiercest spirit among the petty tribes, and in the personal
encounters of savages like those of whom we are treating.
Various causes of misunderstanding will, of course,
arise among them from time to time, and every trifling
quarrel is continued and inflamed by their amazing and
persevering efforts to revenge themselves, which appears
to be with them considered a matter of duty.
The shedding of blood is always followed by punishment,
and only those who are <em>jee-dyte</em>, or unconnected
with the family of the guilty person, can consider themselves
in safety from this evil spirit of revenge. Little
children of seven or eight years old, if, while playing,
they hear that some murder has taken place, can in a
moment tell whether or not they are <em>jee-dyte</em>, and even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
at this tender age, take their measures accordingly.
An example of this unsparing visitation of offences
occurred not long after the settlement of New South
Wales had commenced. A native had been murdered,
and his widow, being obliged to revenge his death,
chanced to meet with a little girl distantly related to
the murderer, upon whom she instantly poured forth
her fury, beating her cruelly about the head with a club
and pointed stone, until at length she caused the child&#8217;s
death. When this was mentioned before the other
natives, they appeared to look upon it as a right and
necessary act, nor was the woman punished by the
child&#8217;s relatives, possibly because it was looked upon
as a just requital.</p>

<p>When a native has received any injury, whether real
or fancied, he is very apt to work himself up into a
tremendous passion, and for this purpose certain war-songs,
especially if they are chanted by women, seem
amazingly powerful. Indeed, it is stated, on good
authority, that four or five mischievously-inclined old
women can soon stir up forty or fifty men to any deed of
blood, by means of their chants, which are accompanied
by tears and groans, until the men are excited into a
perfect state of frenzy. The men also have their war-songs,
which they sing as they walk rapidly backwards
and forwards, quivering their spears, in order to work
themselves up into a passion. The following very common
one may serve for a specimen, both of the manner
and matter of this rude, yet, to them, soul-stirring
poetry:&mdash;</p>

And thus it is that a native, when he feels afraid,
sings himself into courage, or, if he is already in a bold
mood, he heaps fuel upon the flame of his anger, and
adds strength to his fury. The deadly feeling of hatred
and revenge extends itself to their public, as well as to
their private, quarrels, and sometimes shows itself in a
very fierce and unexpected manner. In the valley of the
Wollombi, between Sydney and Hunter&#8217;s River, some
years ago, three boys of a certain tribe had been persuaded
to reside in the families of three of the British
settlers there. These were marked out for vengeance
by the natives belonging to a tribe in a state of warfare
with them, about 100 of whom travelled between 20 and
30 miles during one night&mdash;a thing almost unheard of
among the natives&mdash;and reached the neighbourhood of
the settlers on the Wollombi very early on the ensuing
morning. Two or three of them were sent to each of
the houses to entice the boys out, but these, it appeared,
somewhat suspected the intentions of their enemies.
However, they were at length persuaded to join the
native dance, when suddenly a circle was formed round
them, and they were speedily beaten to death with
<em>waddies</em> or clubs. Immediately after which deed, the
troop of natives returned back again to their own
neighbourhood. A European happened to pass by, just as
the boys were dying, but being alone and unarmed, his
interference might have been dangerous to himself,
without proving of any the slightest advantage to the
unfortunate sufferers.</p>

<p>Another instance of that cowardly cruelty, which will
take every possible advantage of a helpless age and sex
occurred many years before this, when the colony of
New South Wales was quite in its infancy. The father
and mother of a little native girl, aged about seven years,
had belonged to a party by whom many robberies had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
been committed on the banks of the river Hawkesbury,
but an armed troop of Europeans was sent in pursuit of
these robbers, and when a meeting took place, the
child&#8217;s parents were among those that fell, while she
accompanied the victorious party to the British settlement.
Here she behaved herself with propriety,
being a well-disposed child, she was a favourite at
Government-house, where she resided under the protection
of the governor. This circumstance, and the fact
of her belonging to a different tribe from their own,
awakened the jealousy of some of the natives, who
belonged to the neighbourhood of Sydney, and she was
consequently put to death in the most cruel manner.
Her body was found in the woods, speared in several
places, and with both the arms cut off. The murderers
of the poor child escaped.</p>

<p>But, while we justly condemn and pity the cruel and
cowardly acts of this description, which, unhappily, too
often figure among the deeds of the natives of the
Australian Bush, we are by no means to suppose them
wanting in all feeling of kindness and humanity, still
less would it be correct to consider them deficient in true
courage. Every allowance ought to be made for the
disadvantages of savage life, for the complete ignorance
of these people, for the difficulty which they frequently
have in procuring necessary food, and for the consequent
cheapness in which life is held among them; and when
these and other like arguments are duly weighed, we
may learn not to abominate less the crimes of savages,
but to pity more the unhappy beings who commit them.
Indeed, if we go somewhat further, we may take shame
to ourselves and to all civilized nations, in many of
whose practices a counterpart may be found for the
worst sins of the uncultivated, uncivilized heathens.</p>

<p>Within the last few years many crimes have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
recorded in our newspapers, which, though committed
in those large English towns, by some conceived to be
centres of civilization, refinement, and enlightenment,
might rival in horror and atrocity the very darkest deeds
of savages.</p>

<p>Many proofs that the disposition of the native Australians
is naturally brave and courageous (however
cowardly some of their barbarities may appear,) could
easily be brought forward; but none can be a stronger
proof of this than the coolness and self-possession
which they have so frequently exhibited upon meeting
with Europeans, and encountering their fire-arms for
the first time. An example of this occurred in Western
Australia, when Captain Grey&#8217;s party were on their
return home towards the British settlement of Perth.
They were winding their way along on the summit of a
limestone hill not very far from the coast, which formed
a terrace about half a mile in width, with rich grass and
beautiful clumps of trees to adorn it; and while, on the
side towards the land, another terrace arose exactly like
it, on the opposite side they overlooked a bay surrounded
by verdant and extensive flats. Their enjoyment
of the lovely scenery of this spot was soon
disturbed by the appearance of a large body of the
natives on the high ground to the east of them; and,
although these strangers boldly advanced to within 200
yards of them, all endeavours to bring about an amicable
meeting proved in vain, for the savages shouted
to their companions, and these again to others yet more
remote, until the calls were lost in the distance, while
fresh parties of natives came trooping in from all directions.
The question was, how to get rid of these people
without bloodshed; and when an attempt to move quietly
forward had been disappointed, by the Australians
hastening on to occupy a thick piece of bush, through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which the English party must pass, at last, Captain
Grey, advancing towards them with his gun cocked and
pointed, drove them a little before him, after which, to
complete their dispersion, he intended to fire over their
heads. But, to his mortification and their delight, the
gun missed fire, upon which the natives, taking fresh
courage, turned round to make faces at him and to
imitate the snapping of the gun. The second barrel was
then fired over their heads, at which they were alarmed,
and made a rapid retreat, halting, however, upon a
rising ground about 300 yards off, and preparing in
earnest for action, when they perceived that they had
suffered no loss. But since they had thus learned to
despise the weapons of European warfare, prompt action
was needful to prevent fatal consequences on both sides.
The captain, accordingly, took his rifle from the man
who was carrying it, and directing it at a heap of
closely-matted dead bushes, about two or three yards
from the main body of the enemy, he drove the ball
right through it; the dry rotten boughs crackled and
flew in all directions, and the poor savages, confounded
at this new and unfair mode of fighting, hastily dispersed,
without any loss of life having been sustained
by either party.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion, not long after this encounter,
and in the same neighbourhood, the party of English
explorers fell in with a native carrying his spear and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
handful of fish; he was lost in thought, and they were
close to him before he saw them, but, when he did so,
he took no notice of them. Without even quickening
his pace, he continued in his own course, which crossed
their path, and, as he evidently wished to avoid all
communication, the men were ordered to take no notice of
him, and so they passed one another. He must have
been a very brave fellow, observes the captain, to act
thus coolly, when an array so strange to him met his
eye. In like manner, when Major Mitchell was riding
upon the banks of the Gwydir, he fell in with a tall
native, covered with pipe-clay, who, although he could
never have seen a horse before, nevertheless, put himself
in a posture of defiance, and did not retreat, until
the traveller galloped at him to prevent his attack.</p>

<p>In a different part of New Holland, on the eastern
coast, when Flinders was exploring Pumice-stone River,
near Moreton Bay, he was by no means successful in
striking the natives with awe and astonishment. A
hawk having presented itself to view, he thought this
afforded a good opportunity of showing his new friends,
the inhabitants of the Bush, a specimen of the effect and
certainty of his fire-arms. He made them understand
what he intended, and they were so far alarmed as to
seem to be on the point of running into the woods, but
a plan of detaining them was discovered, for the seamen
placed themselves in front of the savages, forming a
kind of defence; in which situation they anxiously
watched the British officer, while he fired at the bird.
What must have been his feelings at the moment!&mdash;the
hawk, uninjured, flew away!<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
It is, certainly, no easy task to awaken in the soul of
the completely savage man any great interest or concern
in the ways and habits of civilized life. The fallen
nature, of which all mankind are common partakers,
renders it, unfortunately, easy to copy what is evil;
and, accordingly, the drunkenness, the deceitfulness,
and general licentiousness of depraved Europeans find
many admirers and imitators among the simple children
of the Australian wilderness; but when anything good,
or decent, or even merely useful, is to be taught them,
then do they appear dull and inapt scholars indeed.
Living, as they do, in a peculiar world, as it were, of
their own, they feel little or no pleasure at hearing of
what is going on elsewhere, and it has been observed by
one who had mixed very much with their various tribes,
and had gained considerable knowledge of their language,
that, while they cared not for stories respecting man in
his civilized state, anything at all bearing upon savage
life was eagerly listened to and well received. Once,
having described to them some circumstances respecting
England and its inhabitants, the traveller took occasion,
from the mention of the length of days there in summer,
to speak of those lands near the North Pole, where, in
summer, the sun never sets, while it never rises for
some weeks during the winter. The natives agreed that
this must be another sun, and not the one seen by them;
but, when the conversation turned upon the people of
those northern regions, and the small Laplander, clothed
in skins of the seal, instead of the kangaroo, was described
to them, they were exceedingly delighted; and
this picture of half-savage life, so different from their
own, threw quite into the shade all the other stories
they had heard. It is, indeed, really laughable to find
with what cool contempt some of these natives, who
have never had any intercourse with Europeans, treat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
our comforts, our tastes, and pursuits. We may contemn
and pity them, but they seem to have very much
the same feelings for us. We are horrified at the greediness
with which they devour grubs, and many of them
are shocked at our oyster-eating propensities! A remarkable
instance of this occurred to Captain Flinders
in 1798, when he was exploring the eastern coast of
New Holland, and surveying Two-fold Bay. While
measuring a base line upon the beach, the English
sailors heard the screams of three native women, who
took up their children and ran off in great alarm. Soon
after this a man made his appearance, armed only with
a <em>waddie</em>, or wooden scimetar, but approaching them
apparently with careless confidence. The explorers
made much of him, and gave him some biscuit; in return
for which he presented them with a piece of gristly fat,
probably of whale. This was tasted by Captain Flinders,
but he was forced to watch for an opportunity of getting
rid of it while the eyes of the donor were not upon him.
But the savage himself was, curiously enough, doing
precisely the same thing with the biscuit, the taste of
which was, perhaps, no more agreeable to him than that
of the whale to the Englishman. The commencement
of the trigonometrical operations necessary for surveying
the bay was beheld by the Australian with indifference,
if not with contempt; and he quitted the strangers,
apparently satisfied that from people who could thus
seriously occupy themselves there was no great danger
to be feared.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be urged respecting the variety of
tastes and the want of a settled and uniform standard of
appeal respecting them; however it may be argued the
rich and luscious fat of a noble whale may intrinsically
surpass the lean and mouldy flavour of dry sea-biscuit;
nevertheless, in many other matters of greater importance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
it must be confessed that the manners and habits
of the natives of the Bush are extremely wretched and
evil. And the Christian European, while he dares not
<em>despise</em> them, cannot do otherwise than <em>pity</em> them. The
fact has been already noticed, that these miserable
children of nature scarcely ever wear anything deserving
of the name of clothing; and, in many parts of New
Holland, their huts, usually constructed by the women,
and composed of little better materials than bark, or
wood, and boughs,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> reeds, or clay, scarcely merit the
title of human habitations. But it is not so much in
their outward state, as in their moral and social habits,
that this race of men are most pitiable and degraded.
One subject which has been frequently observed to mark
the difference not so much between civilized and uncivilized
men, as that between Christians and heathens,
must especially be noticed. Cruel as is <em>the treatment of
women</em> in many other parts of the globe, the inhabitants
of Australia seem to go beyond all other barbarians in
this respect. From the best and wisest people of
christian Europe down to the vilest and most degraded
tribes of heathen Australia, a regular scale might be
formed of the general mode of behaviour to the weaker
sex among these various nations; and, mostly, it would
be found that the general superiority or inferiority of
each nation is not untruly indicated by the kindness or
cruelty with which their females are usually treated.</p>

<p>From their earliest infancy the female children are
engaged or betrothed to a future husband, and in case
of his death, they belong to his heir. But this arrangement
is frequently prevented by the horrid practice,
common among these barbarians, of stealing their wives,
and taking them away by main force. Indeed, it seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a rule for the women to follow the conquering party, as
a matter of course; so that on the return of an expedition
into the interior of New Holland, the friendly and neighbouring
natives, being informed that some of the distant
and hostile people had been shot, only observed, &ldquo;Stupid
white fellows! why did you not bring away the gins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polygamy is not uncommonly practised; and an old
man, especially, among other privileges, may have as
many <em>gins</em>, or wives, as he can keep, or maintain. Indeed,
the maintenance of a wife is not expensive, since
they are expected to work; and all the most laborious
tasks, including that of supplying a great part of the
necessary food for the family, are performed by them.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Hence, they are watched with very jealous care, being
valuable possessions; but, in spite of all precautions,
they are frequently carried off, and that in the most
inhuman manner. The <em>lover</em> steals upon the encampment
by night, and, discovering where the object of his
affection is, he frequently beats her on the head till she
becomes senseless, and then drags her off through the
bushes, as a tiger would its prey!<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> This, of course, is
an undertaking attended with considerable danger; for
if the intruder is caught, he will be speared through the
leg, or even killed, by the angry husband or relatives.
Thus many quarrels arise, in which brothers or friends
are generally ready enough to bear a part. But&mdash;unlike
the courteous and christian customs of our own
country&mdash;the poor female, whether innocent or guilty,
it matters not, has no one to take her part; the established
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
rule with regard to women among these brutal
creatures being, &ldquo;If I beat your mother, then you beat
mine; if I beat your wife, then you beat mine,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.
The consequence of these ferocious habits is evident
enough in the appearance of most of the young women,
who have any good looks or personal comeliness to
boast of. The number of violent blows upon the head,
or of rude wounds inflicted by the spear, form so many
miserable trophies of victories dearly won by these
Australian beauties, and the early life of one of these
unhappy beings is generally a continued series of captivities
to different masters, of wanderings in strange
families, of rapid flights, of bad treatment from other
females, amongst whom she is brought a stranger by
her captor; and rarely is a form of unusual grace and
elegance seen, but it is marked and scarred by the furrows
of old wounds; while many females thus wander
several hundreds of miles from the home of their infancy,
without any corresponding ties of affection being formed
to recompense them for those so rudely torn asunder.
As may be well imagined, a marriage thus roughly commenced
is not very smooth in its continuance; and the
most cruel punishments&mdash;violent beating, throwing
spears or burning brands, &amp;c.&mdash;are frequently inflicted
upon the weaker party, without any sufficient provocation
having been given. It is evident, that treatment of
this kind, together with the immensely long journeys
which they are compelled to take, always accompanying
their husbands on every excursion, must be very injurious
to the constitution and healthiness of the weaker
sex. And to these trials must be added the constant
carrying of those children that are yet unable to travel,
the perpetual search for food, and preparation of it when
it is obtained, besides many other laborious offices performed
by the women, all which being reckoned up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
together, will form a life of toil and misery, which we
may hope is endured by no other human beings beside
the females of Australia. Nor is such treatment without
its ill effect upon the tempers and dispositions of the
female sex. The ferocity of the women, when it is
excited, exceeds that of the men; they deal dreadful
blows at one another with their long sticks, and, if ever
the husband is about to spear in the leg, or beat, one of
his wives, the others are certain to set on her, and treat
her with great inhumanity.</p>

<p>One custom, which to Europeans seems extremely
remarkable, is that of the family name of the <em>mother</em>,
and not of the <em>father</em>, becoming the surname of the
children of either sex. And another, connected with
this, forbids a man from marrying with a woman of his
own family name. Each family has for its crest or sign,
or <em>kobong</em>, as they call it, some animal or vegetable; and
a certain mysterious connexion is supposed to exist
between a family and its <em>kobong</em>; so that a member of
the family will never kill an animal of the same species
with his <em>kobong</em>, should he find it asleep; indeed, he always
kills it reluctantly, and never without affording it
a chance of escape.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> This arises from the family belief
that some one individual of the species is their nearest
friend, to kill whom would be a great crime, and is to
be carefully avoided. And, in like manner, a native having
a vegetable for a <em>kobong</em> may not gather it under certain
circumstances, and at a particular period of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
year. It is said that they occasionally exchange surnames
with their friends, a custom which is supposed to
have prevailed among the Jews; and they have another
practice resembling the same people, which is, that when
a husband dies, his brother takes the wife.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Among
beings who hold life so cheaply, it cannot be a matter of
surprise that the destruction of infants should be occasionally
practised, more especially in cases where the
child is born with any natural deformity: nor is it an
excuse for these barbarians that the polished nations of
ancient Greece and Italy habitually committed the like
atrocities, or even greater,&mdash;considering it in their own
choice to rear up their offspring or not, exactly as it
suited their convenience. In fact, we may learn from
this and many other instances, that it is not <em>civilisation</em>
alone, but yet more than that, <em>Christianity</em>, by which the
difference between the European and the Australian is
produced:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;In vain are arts pursued, or taste refin&#8217;d,</span><br />
 Unless Religion purifies the mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Respecting the languages spoken in different parts
of New Holland, it is doubtful whether they have all a
common root or not, but the opinion of Captain Grey,
who was not unqualified to judge, is in favour of their
kindred origin. In so vast an extent of country, among
wandering tribes, that hold little or no communication
with each other, great differences in language were to
be expected, and are found to exist. If three men from
the east, the west, and the north of England meet
together, they occasionally puzzle one another by their
various dialects; what, then, must be expected by way of
variety in a country between two and three thousand
miles across, without much communication, and totally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
differing, at its extreme points, in climate and in animal
and vegetable productions? For new objects new names
were, of necessity, invented; but the resemblance between
words signifying objects common everywhere, as,
for instance, the parts of the human body, is said to be
remarkable. The Australian languages are stated to be
soft and melodious in their sound, and their songs,
though rude and wild, have amazing power over the
feelings of the soul. <em>Noise</em> would appear to have great
charms in savage ears, and, sometimes, from the high
key in which our English songs are occasionally pitched,
it would seem to have charms also for &ldquo;ears polite.&rdquo;
But an elegant and refined European song would only
be laughed at and mimicked by the musical blacks, some
few of whom are not, however, quite insensible to the
sweets of civilised melody. Warrup, a native servant,
was once present when &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; was
sung in chorus, and it so affected him, that he burst
into tears. He certainly could not have understood the
words, much less could he have entered into the noble
and loyal spirit, of our National Anthem: it must, therefore,
have been the music, and, perhaps, the excitement
prevailing around him, which affected him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE IN THE BUSH.</strong></p>


<p>One of the most important occupations of every man
in this present state of things, is the pursuit of food and
necessary sustenance for himself and those belonging to
him. But this occupation, being in some respects more
difficult, or at least, more uncertain and engrossing,
stands more forward in savage life, and appears more
important than ever; while, at the same time, the
contrast upon this subject between the rude child of
nature and the civilized inhabitants of the earth, becomes
even stronger than usual. In glancing over the
condition of the native of the Bush in Australia, with
respect to his supply of needful support, and his means
of obtaining it, several truths are to be borne in remembrance,
obvious indeed when pointed out, and yet not
unlikely to escape a casual observer. First, the vast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
extent of country, compared with the thin and scattered
population it maintains; next, the very different sort of
food required by a savage and a European; and lastly,
the various kinds of food which are used by the inhabitants
of the wilderness&mdash;are all matters which must be
recollected, if we would form a fair judgment upon the
subject, and do justice to the humble, and apparently
scanty, bill of fare which Nature has provided for those
that dwell among her wildest scenes and in her most
secret, recesses. In these spots it is but rarely, of
course, from the mere absence of sufficient provisions,
that any large body of natives can assemble together;
but, occasionally, a feast is prepared for a considerable
number, either when some particular article of food
abounds at a certain place and is in full season, or,
especially, when a whale (a fish very common on the
coasts of New Holland) is thrown ashore. In the
latter case, it is impossible for us entirely to enter into
the feelings of the savage, for we have never, unexpectedly,
had so large a quantity of what is considered
the greatest delicacy placed at once before us. Hence,
when the Australian finds a whale thrown ashore in his
own district, his heart warms and opens with kind
feelings of hospitality; he longs to see all his friends
about him, and large fires are immediately kindled to
announce the fortunate and joyful event. Notice of the
feast having been thus given, and a due invitation forwarded,
he rubs himself all over with the blubber, and
his favourite wives are served in the same manner, after
which, he begins to cut his way into the flesh of the
whale, the grain of which is about the firmness of a
goose-quill; of this he chooses the nicest morsels, and
either broils them on the fire, or cooks them by cutting
them into small pieces, and spitting them on a pointed
stick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Other natives, attracted by the flaming signal of
revelry, soon assemble in gay companies from all
quarters: by night they dance and sing, and by day
they eat and sleep, and the feast continues unchecked
until they at last fairly eat their way into the whale,
and may be seen climbing in and about the carcase
choosing their favourite pieces. The fish, in a few days,
becomes more disagreeable than ever, but still they will
not leave it, until they have been completely gorged
with it,&mdash;out of temper from indigestion, and therefore
engaged in frequent quarrels. And, even when they are,
at length, obliged to quit the feast, they carry off with
them as much as they can stagger under, to eat upon
the way, and to take as a rarity to their distant friends.
Such is a true picture of a native Australian feast, and
the polished sons and daughters of Europe will turn away
from it with feelings of unmingled disgust. But, with
how many of these is life itself a perpetual series of
feasting, less gross and disgusting indeed, but not less
really sensual than this! How many inhabitants of
civilised countries live continually as though the saying,
&ldquo;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die&rdquo; were
the whole sum and substance of practical wisdom! Yet
if it were so, who would be more happy, who more
blessed in his situation, than the savage devouring, day
after day, the food his heart delights in?</p>

<p>But a whale-feast is an event of no ordinary kind in
the life of an inhabitant of the Bush, and, if we would
know how the common sustenance of life is procured
by him, we must follow him through a variety of scenes
and pursuits, of which, by no means the least important
or interesting, is the chase of the kangaroo.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
This singular and harmless creature is now so well
known to Europeans, from specimens that have been
brought over and placed in our public collections of
animals, and also from numberless pictures, that it
would be waste of time to stop to describe it. In truth,
being one of the productions peculiar to Australia, it
may be said, from the figures of it to be seen upon the
back of every book relating to that country, to have become
almost the <em>kobong</em> or crest of that southern region.
In many portions of New Holland, particularly where
the country is wooded and the soil tolerably fertile,
kangaroos are very abundant; but so great havoc is
made among these defenceless creatures by their various
enemies, especially by man, that their numbers appear
to be upon the decrease.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>A day&#8217;s hunting is often the cause of no small excitement,
even in England, among men who care nothing
for the object of their chase, and are certain of a good
dinner at the end of their day&#8217;s sport; but we may suppose
this to be a matter of more serious interest to the
Australian, who depends upon his skill and patience in
hunting for his daily food. His whole manner and
appearance, accordingly, are changed on these occasions;
his eyes brighten up, his motion becomes quick though
silent, and every token of his eagerness and anxiety is
discoverable in his behaviour. Earth, water, trees, sky,
are all in turn the subjects of his keenest search, and
his whole soul appears to be engaged in his two senses
of sight and hearing. His wives, and even his children,
become perfectly silent, until, perhaps, a suppressed
whistle is given by one of the women, denoting that she
sees a kangaroo near her husband, after which all is
again quiet, and an unpractised stranger might ride
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
within a few yards of the group, and not perceive a
living thing. The devoted animal, meanwhile, after
listening two or three times without being able to perceive
any further cause of alarm, returns to its food or
other occupation in complete security, while the watchful
savage poises his spear, and lifts up his arm ready
for throwing it, and then advances slowly and with
stealth towards his prey, no part moving but his legs.
Whenever the kangaroo looks round, its enemy stands
still in the same position he is in when it first raises its
head, until the animal, again assured of safety, gives a
skip or two, and goes on feeding: again the native
advances, and the same scene occurs, until the whizzing
spear penetrates the unfortunate creature, upon which
the whole wood rings with sudden shouts; women and
children all join in the chase, and, at last, the kangaroo,
weakened from loss of blood and encumbered by the
spear, places its back against a tree, and appears to
attack its pursuer with the fury of despair. Though
naturally a timid animal, it will, when it is hard pressed
for life, make a bold stand; and, if hunted by Europeans,
will sometimes wait for the dogs and tear them with its
hind claws, or squeeze them with its fore arms, until the
blood gushes out of the hound&#8217;s nostrils; and sometimes
the poor creature will take to the water, and drown
every dog that comes near it.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But by the natives the
poor beast is generally soon dispatched with spears
thrown from a distance, and its body is carried off by its
conqueror and his wives to some convenient resting-place
where they may enjoy their meal.</p>

<p>There is likewise another mode of hunting the same
animal, in which many persons join together, and which,
though more lively and noisy, is not so characteristical
as the first. A herd of kangaroos are surprised either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
in a thick bushy place, to which they have retired during
the heat of the day, or else in an open plain. In the
first case, they are encircled by a party, each native
giving a low whistle, as he takes up his place, and when
the blockade is finished, the bushes are set on fire, and
the frightened animals fly from the flames towards the
open plains; but no sooner do they approach the outskirts
of the wood, than the bushes are fired in the
direction in which they are running, while they are
driven back by loud calls and tremendous cries, which
increase their terror, and they run wildly about, until,
at length, maddened by fear, they make a rush through
their enemies, who allow but few of them to escape.
When the kangaroos are surrounded upon a plain, the
point generally chosen is an open bottom encircled by
wood; each native has his place given him by some of
the elder ones, and all possible means that art, or experience,
or the nature of the ground, can furnish, are
employed to ensure success in approaching as nearly as
may be towards the animals without disturbing them.
Thus the circle narrows round the unwary herd, till at
last one of them becomes alarmed, and bounds away;
but its flight is speedily stopped by a savage with fearful
yells; and before the first moments of terror and
surprise have passed by, the armed natives come running
upon them from every side, brandishing their spears,
and raising loud cries; nor does the slaughter, thus
commenced, commonly finish before the greater number
of them have fallen. These public hunts are conducted
under certain rules; for example, the supposed owner of
the land must be present, and must have invited the party,
or a deadly fight between human beings is pretty sure
to take place. The first spear that strikes a kangaroo
settles whose property the dead animal is to be; however
slight the wound, and even though inflicted by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
boy only, this rule holds good; and if the creature killed
is one which the boy may not yet lawfully eat,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> then his
right passes on to his father, or nearest male relative.
The cries of the hunters are said to be very beautiful
and expressive, and they vary at different periods of the
chase, being readily understood and answered by all, so
that they can thus explain their meaning to one another
at a very great distance.</p>

<p>But, since the kangaroo is one of the principal articles
of food in the wilds of New Holland, there are yet other
modes of taking it, which are commonly practised.</p>

<p>Sometimes they use the ordinary methods of catching
it in nets or pitfalls. Occasionally, also, in a dry district,
where many animals assemble together from a great
distance to drink at some solitary piece of water, the
huntsman builds for himself a rude place of shelter, in
which for hours he remains concealed and motionless,
until the thirsty animals approach in sufficient numbers.
Then kangaroos, cockatoos, pigeons, &amp;c. are attacked
and destroyed without mercy, and the patience of the
hunter is commonly richly rewarded by the booty he
obtains.</p>

<p>But the mode of tracking a kangaroo until it is wearied
out, is the one which, beyond all others, commands the
admiration of the Australians, for it calls forth the exercise
of every quality most highly prized among savages,
skill in following traces, endurance of hunger and thirst,
unwearied bodily exertion, and lasting perseverance.
To perform this task the hunter starts upon the track
of the kangaroo, which he follows until he catches sight
of the animal, as it flies timidly before him; again he
pursues the track, and again the object of his pursuit
bounds away from him; and this is repeated until nightfall,
when the pursuer lights his fire and sleeps upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the track. With the first light of day the hunt is renewed,
and, towards the close of the second day, or in
the course of the third, the kangaroo, wearied and exhausted
by the chase, will allow the hunter to approach
near enough to spear it. None but a skilful hunter, in
the pride of youth and strength can perform this feat,
and one who has frequently practised it always enjoys
great fame amongst his companions.</p>

<p>When the kangaroo has been obtained in some one
or other of these various methods, the first operation is
to take off the skin of the tail, the sinews of which are
carefully preserved to sew cloaks or bags, or to make
spears. The next thing to be thought of is the cooking
of the flesh; and two modes of doing this are common.
One of these is to make an oven by digging a hole in the
sand, and lighting a fire in it; when the sand is well
heated, and a large heap of ashes is collected, the hole
is scraped out, and the kangaroo is placed in it, skin and
all; it is then covered over with ashes, and a slow fire
is kept up above it; when baked enough, it is taken
out and laid upon its back, the intestines are then
removed, and the whole of the gravy is left in the body
of the animal, which is carefully taken out of the skin,
and then cut up and eaten. Travellers in the Bush
speak very highly of the delicious flavour of the meat
thus curiously cooked. The other mode of dressing is
merely to broil different portions of the kangaroo upon
the fire, and it may be noticed that certain parts, as the
blood, the entrails, and the marrow, are reckoned great
dainties. Of these the young men are forbidden to
partake. Of the blood a sort of long sausage is made,
and this is afterwards eaten by the person of most consequence
in the company.</p>

<p>Another abundant source of food is supplied to the
native population of New Holland at certain seasons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in particular situations, by the various sorts of fish
which abound on its coasts, and in its bays and inlets.
From this, most probably, arises the fact observed by
Captain Flinders, that the borders of bays, and entrances
of rivers, are in New Holland always most thickly
peopled. And Collins mentions a sort of fancied superiority,
which these people pretend to, above those that
dwell in the more inland parts. &ldquo;The natives of the
coast,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;when speaking of those in the interior,
constantly expressed themselves with contempt and
marks of disapprobation.&rdquo; So very similar are the airs
and vanity of a savage, to those in which civilised man
indulges. The three most common modes of catching
fish are, by spearing them, taking them by means of a
weir constructed across places which are left nearly dry
at low water, or after a flood, and enclosing them in a
net, prepared by the women out of grassy fibres, and
one of their greatest efforts of ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Nothing
very remarkable is to be noticed in these modes of
fishing, except it be the speed with which they run
along the shore, and the certainty with which they
aim their spears at the inhabitants of the shallow bays
and open lakes. As surely as the natives disappear under
the surface of the water, so surely will they reappear with
a fish writhing upon the point of their short spears; and
even under water their aim is always correct. One
traveller, Sturt, is of opinion that they seldom eat the
finny tribes when they can get anything else, but this
idea seems scarcely to agree with the report of others.
At all events, whether from choice or not, a large proportion
of their subsistence is derived from the waters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
With regard to the cookery of their fish, the Australian
barbarians are said to have a most admirable method of
dressing them, not unworthy of being copied by other
nations. If the fish are not simply broiled upon the
fire, they are laid in a piece of paper bark, which is wrapt
round them, as paper is folded round a cutlet; strings
of grass are then wound tightly about the bark and fish,
which is slowly baked in heated sand, covered with hot
ashes; when it is sufficiently cooked, the bark is opened,
and answers the purpose of a dish; it is, of course, full of
juice and gravy, not a drop of which has escaped. The
flavour of many sorts of fish thus dressed is said to be
delicious, and sometimes pieces of kangaroo and other
meats are cooked in the same manner.</p>

<p>The seal is exceedingly abundant on many parts of
the Australian coast, and is also useful to the natives
for purposes of food, while the pursuit of this creature is
an exciting sport for the inhabitants of the southern and
western shores of New Holland. The animal must be
surprised upon the beach, or in the surf, or among the
rocks that lie at no great distance from the shore; and the
natives delight in the pursuit, clambering about the wild
crags that encircle their own land; sometimes leaping
from one rock to another, spearing the fish that lie in
the quiet pools between, in the next moment dashing
into the surf to fight with a seal or turn a turtle;
these are to them agreeable and joyous occupations.
And when we remember that their steps are followed by
a wife and children, as dear to them, probably, as ours
are to us, who are witnesses of their skill and activity;
and who, when the game is killed, will help to light the
fire with which it is to be cooked, and to drag it to the
resting-place, where the father romps with his little ones
until the meal is made ready; when we recollect, likewise,
that all this takes place in a climate so mild and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
genial, that a house is not necessary, we shall feel less
surprise at the difficulty of persuading an inhabitant of
the Bush to fall into European customs, and submit to
the trammels of civilised life.</p>

<p>The turtle, must by no means be forgotten, in an account
of the different articles of provision upon which an
Australian has to depend for his supply. These useful
creatures are to be found chiefly on the coast in the
warmer portions of New Holland, and are in high
season about December and January, the height of summer
in Australia. The green turtles are surprised upon
the beach when they come to lay their eggs; but the
fresh-water turtle is found (as its name implies,) in fresh
lakes and ponds, at the season when these are most
dried up, and their margin is overgrown with reeds and
rushes. Among these the natives wade with stealthy
pace, so quietly indeed, that they even creep upon wild
fowl and spear them. The turtles swim lazily along the
surface of the water, biting and smelling the various
aquatic plants they meet with, but as soon as they are
alarmed, they sink to the bottom instantly. The pursuer
puts out his foot, (the toes of which he uses to
seize anything, almost as we use our fingers,) and gropes
about with it among the weeds at the bottom of the water
until he feels the turtle; and then, holding it to the
ground, he plunges his hands and arms in and seizes his
prey. In this manner two or three men have been
known to take fourteen turtles in a very short time;
but these are small, weighing from one to two or three
pounds each. The fresh-water turtle is cooked, after
the Australian fashion, by being baked, shell and all, in
hot ashes; and when it is sufficiently dressed, the bottom
shell is removed with ease, and the whole animal remains
in the upper shell, which serves for a dish. They are
generally very fat and delicious, so that the New Hollanders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
are extremely fond of them, and the turtle
season, being an important part of the year, is looked
forward to with pleasure. The green turtles, which are
a much larger animal, found only by the sea-side, are
taken when crawling on the beach. If they by accident
get upon their backs, they are unable to right themselves,
and perish miserably, so that nothing more is necessary
to secure them, than to place them in that posture, and
they may be taken away and devoured at leisure.
Among Wellesley Islands, at the bottom of the Gulph of
Carpentaria, in the north of New Holland, Captain
Flinders obtained in one day, in this manner, no less
than forty-six turtles, the least of them weighing 250lbs,
and the average being about 300lbs; besides which,
many that were not wanted, because there was no room
to stow them away, were turned again, and suffered to
make their escape.</p>

<p>Opossum hunting offers another means of supplying
food to the Australians, and as these quadrupeds usually
dwell in the hollows of decayed trees, and ascend the
trees when they are at all alarmed, the mode of pursuing
them is of a new and different character. The first
thing to be done is to ascertain that the opossum has
really concealed itself somewhere in the tree. To discover
this the holes made by the nails of the animal in
the bark as it climbed up, are sufficient; only, one of these
footmarks having a little sand in it is anxiously sought
for, and if this sand sticks together, when the hunter
blows gently upon it, it is a proof, since it is not dry
enough yet to blow away, that the opossum has gone up
into the tree that very morning. The dextrous savage
then pulls out his hatchet,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> a rude <em>stone hatchet</em>&mdash;unless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
he has been fortunate enough to get a better one from
some European, and cuts a notch in the bark of the
tree sufficiently large and deep to receive the ball of his
great toe. The first notch being thus made, about four feet
from the ground, he places the toe of his right foot in it,
throws his right arm round the tree, and with his left
hand sticks the point of the handle of his hatchet into the
bark, as high up as he can reach, and thus forms a stay
to drag himself up with. This first step being made good,
he cuts another for his left foot, and so on, always
clinging with the left hand and cutting with the right,
resting the whole weight of the body upon the toe of
either foot, until the hole is reached where the opossum
lies hidden, which is then compelled by smoke, or by
being poked out, to quit its hiding place; when the
conqueror, catching hold of his victim&#8217;s tail, dashes it
down on the ground, and quietly descends after it. As
the bite of the opossum is very painful and severe, due
care is taken, in laying hold of it, to keep clear of all
danger from its teeth. Occasionally trees of 130 feet
in height have been observed, which had been <em>notched</em>
by the natives up to at least eighty feet! and the old
notches are never again used, but new ones are cut
every time. Strange to tell, this very difficult operation
of following the opossum is not uncommonly performed
by moonlight, some persons moving onwards to detect
the animal feeding, while others follow, creeping after
them with fire-sticks; and it is curious to watch the
dark body of the savage, climbing the tree, contrasted
with the pale moonlight. The Australians are fond of
these expeditions, the end of which is the same as of the
others conducted in broad daylight&mdash;the poor opossum
is reached, and knocked down with a stick, or shaken
off the branch to which he had fled as a last retreat.</p>

<p>Birds form a considerable article of food in the wilds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of New Holland, and there are many various sorts of
them, as well as many different modes of killing and
ensnaring them, which it would be tedious to dwell
upon; but the emu, or cassowary, is too important and
remarkable to be passed over. This bird is very large,
and its covering resembles hair more than feathers; it
is not able to fly, but it can run more swiftly than the
fleetest dogs, and its kick is violent enough to break a
man&#8217;s leg: it is however easily tamed. The instinctive
dread which these animals in their wild state have of
man is very remarkable. It was observed by Major
Mitchell, on various occasions during his journeys, that
the first appearance of large quadrupeds&mdash;bullocks and
horses, did not scare the emu or kangaroo; but that, on
the contrary, when they would have fled from the first
approach of their enemy man, advancing singly, they
would allow him to draw near when mounted, and even
to dismount, fire from behind a horse, and load again,
without attempting to run off. In hunting the emu, it
matters not how much noise is made, for the natives
say that bird is quite deaf, although its sight is keen in
proportion. The kangaroo must be pursued as silently
as possible.</p>

<p>Emus are killed in the same manner as kangaroos,
but they are more prized by the natives, and the death
of one of these birds awakens a greater excitement in
the spectators; shout succeeds shout, and the distant
sojourners take up the cry, until it is sometimes
reechoed for miles; yet the feast which follows is very
exclusive, the flesh of the emu, which, except in one
part which tastes like beef, is very oily, being thought
by far too delicious to be made a common article of
food. Young men and unprivileged persons are forbidden
to touch it, on pain of severe penalties, which are
strictly enforced. The emus are generally found, like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the kangaroos, in tolerably fertile spots, and like them,
also, are fast disappearing from the neighbourhood of
the haunts of Europeans. The destruction of cockatoos
with the weapon, or throwing stick, called a <em>kiley</em>,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the
hunting and snaring of different sorts of wild fowl, afford
ample room for a display of that cunning, skill, and
amazing patience, which distinguish the character of
uncivilized man. One curious way of catching birds in
Australia is certainly original, if it be but correctly reported.
It is said that a native will, in the heat of the
sun, lay down as if asleep, holding a bit of fish in his
hand; the bird seeing the bait, seizes on the fish, and
the native then catches it! But enough has now been
stated respecting the various ways in which game is taken
in the bush. And although, perhaps, enough has been
said concerning Australian cookery, yet the mode in
which they cook the birds in that country, similar indeed
to the methods already mentioned, may briefly be noted.
When the natives wish to dress a bird very nicely, the
entrails are taken out and cooked separately, (being considered
a great delicacy,) after the example of the
admirers of woodcocks in England. A triangle is then
formed round the bird by three red hot pieces of stick,
against which ashes are placed, hot coals are also
stuffed into the inside of the bird, and it is thus quickly
cooked, and kept full of gravy. In the opinion of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Captain Grey, wild fowl dressed in this manner, on a
clean piece of bark, was as good a dish as he had ever
eaten.</p>

<p>But there are many other kinds of food which custom,
and perhaps necessity, have rendered palatable to the
people of New Holland, but which we can regard only
with disgust and aversion. Among these it may be
scarcely just to reckon <em>frogs</em>, since they are an article of
food in one of the most polished nations of Europe, and
those who have tasted them properly dressed have
usually no fault to find with their flavour. The season
in Australia for catching frogs and fresh-water shell-fish,
is when the swamps are nearly dried up by the heat;
these animals then bury themselves in holes in the
mud, and the native women, with their long sticks, and
taper arms, which they plunge up to the shoulder in the
slime, manage to drag them out. In summer a whole
troop of females may be seen paddling about in a swamp,
slapping themselves to kill the mosquitoes and sandflies,
and every now and then plunging their arms down
into the mud, and dragging forth their prey. Sometimes
one of these women may be seen with ten or twelve
pounds&#8217; weight of frogs in her bag. Frogs are cooked
on a slow fire of wood-ashes, and being held in one hand
by the hind legs, a dexterous pinch with the finger and
thumb of the other at once removes the lower portion of
the intestines, and the remainder of the little animal is
then taken at a mouthful. Muscles are also abundant
in the rivers, and in the north-western parts of New
Holland they form a principal article of food; but in the
south-western districts the inhabitants will not touch
them, for there is a tradition that some persons long ago
ate them and died by means of sorcerers, who considered
that fish to be their peculiar property. Grubs are a
favourite food with some of the Australian natives, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in order to procure them, they are at the pains of breaking
off the top of the trees frequented by these grubs,
since, until its top is dead, the trees do not afford a
proper abode for them. Grubs are eaten either raw, or
else roasted in much the same manner as the fish are.
But taste is proverbially a subject concerning which
there is no accounting by reason, as we must confess
when we find <em>snakes</em>, <em>lizards</em>, <em>rats</em>, <em>mice</em>,
and <em>weasels</em> among
Australian dainties. The smaller quadrupeds are not
skinned before they are cooked, but are dressed with the
skin, the fur being only singed off; and hunger renders
these not only palatable but digestible. Salt is rarely
or never used by the natives, until they have been
taught its use by Europeans; and even then they do not
relish it at first, any more than other sauces or condiments;
indeed, it is quite laughable to see their grimaces
the first time that they taste <em>mustard</em> upon a piece of
meat.</p>

<p>Among vegetable productions there are many roots,
which are eaten by the natives. It is commonly the office
of the women to dig for roots, for which purpose they
carry a long pointed stick to loosen the earth, and that is
afterwards scooped up by the fingers of the left hand.
Their withered arms and hands, covered with earth by
digging and scraping after food, resemble, as they advance
in years, the limbs and claws of a quadruped more than
those of a human being. In stiff soils, this operation
of digging can only be performed when the earth is moist,
but in loose sandy soils it may be always done, and, on
this account, the visits of the natives to different spots
are regulated by the season of the year; as, for example,
the roots that grow in the clay are not in season,
because not to be got at, in the parching and dry months
of summer. No plant bearing seeds is allowed to be dug
up after it has flowered, and the natives are very careful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in observing this rule. A considerable portion of the time
of the women and children is occupied in getting up the
various eatable roots, which are either roasted, or else devoured
in a raw state; some resembling onions and others
potatoes in their flavour. One root, called the <em>mene</em>, has
rather an acid taste, and when eaten alone, it is said to
disorder the bowels; but the natives in the southern
parts pound it between two stones, and sprinkle over it
a few pinches of a kind of <em>earth</em>, which forms, together
with the bruised root, a sort of paste, that is thought
exceedingly good, and quite free from all injurious properties.
A kind of paste, which is sometimes baked into
a cake, is also formed of many other roots. All these
grow wild, and are used exactly in their natural state,
unless burning the leaves of one plant in dry seasons to
improve the root, or similar trifling pains respecting
their growth, can deserve the name of cultivation. The
fungus is also greedily devoured by the unfastidious
natives of Australia, and a kind of gum, resembling what
is in England called <em>gum-tragacanth</em>, is very abundant and
popular among them. One traveller, Captain Sturt,
who was among the first to notice the use of this peculiar
food, imagined that it was eaten only from dire necessity.
Indeed, it is an amusing proof of the occasional errors
into which hasty impressions will lead intelligent men,
that he pities as &ldquo;unfortunate creatures reduced to the
last extremity&rdquo; those who were, in reality, regaling
themselves upon a favourite luxury. During summer
the acacias, growing in swampy plains, are positively
loaded with this gum, and the natives assemble in great
numbers to feast upon it. On such occasions a sort of
fair is held among those that frequent these yearly
meetings, and fun, frolic, and quarrelling of every description
prevail, as in similar meetings of our own countrymen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The pulp of the nut of a species of palm is called
<em>by-yu</em>, and it is a curious fact, that, although in its
natural state this is a rank poison, the natives have,
nevertheless, a method of depriving it of its mischievous
qualities, and it becomes an agreeable and nourishing
article of food. Europeans, ignorant of the mode of
preparing this nut, are sure to pay for their rashness,
if they venture to eat it in its unprepared state. The
women collect these nuts from the palms in the month
of March, (the beginning of autumn,) and leave them
to soak for several days in some shallow pool; after
the <em>by-yu</em> has been sufficiently soaked, they dig, in a
dry sandy place, holes about one foot across and nearly
two feet in depth: these holes are lined with rushes,
and filled with nuts, over which last a little sand is
sprinkled, and then all is covered nicely up with the
tops of the grass-tree. And thus, in about a fortnight,
the pulp which encloses the nut becomes quite dry, and
it is then fit for use: but if eaten before, it produces
the bad effects already mentioned. The pulp is eaten
both raw and roasted; in the latter state, the taste is
said to be equal to that of a chestnut; but this process
has no effect whatever upon the kernels, which act
still as a strong emetic and purgative. This subject
of the sources whence the Australians derive their daily
food from God, who, whether in the north or the south,
in the east or the west, is still found &ldquo;opening his
hand,&rdquo; and &ldquo;filling all things living with plenteousness,&rdquo;
might easily be extended even yet more; for in
so vast a tract of country as New Holland, the varieties
of animal and vegetable food, and the different modes
of obtaining it, must evidently be very numerous.
Enough, however, has been stated to enable the reader
to judge respecting the means of subsistence possessed
by the inhabitants of the Bush; and it will be easily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
seen that this mode of living appears, at the first view,
more precarious and less laborious than it really is.
It is not so precarious a life as it seems to be, because
the articles needful for support, of one kind or
another, are perpetually at hand to those who can find
them and use them, whilst Europeans, or even natives
from a distant part, are often, for want of this power,
in danger of starving in the midst of plenty.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> At the
same time, the savage, free from servile toil and daily
labour though he may appear to be, does in truth earn
his living quite as laboriously as others do; nor is he,
of all men, the most exempt from the general curse
which sin has brought down upon us: &ldquo;In the sweat of
thy face shalt thou eat bread.&rdquo; Enough, likewise, has
been stated respecting the supplies provided in the wilderness
for its inhabitants to qualify us to perceive how
very serious an injury is inflicted upon the original people
of a district in Australia, when Europeans <em>sit down</em>, as
they term it, (i.e. <em>settle</em>,) upon their lands. We might
imagine (however Utopian may be the fancy) a body
of able agriculturists settling in a country but poorly
cultivated, and while they occupied a portion of the
land belonging to the first inhabitants, rendering what
remained to these more valuable by proper cultivation,
than the whole had originally been. But nothing of the
kind is possible with people accustomed from their
infancy to habits of life and means of subsistence like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
those of the Australians. Occupy their land, and the
wild animals must be destroyed or driven away; the
wild plants and roots ploughed up or burnt; or, at all
events, the wild owners of that land must (however
rightful, however ancient, their claim of possession) be
warned off from their own soil, and, as trespassers,
made liable to punishment according to law,&mdash;to European
law.</p>

<p>We are not to suppose from the wandering character
of the life usually led by them, that these human beings
have no notion of property in land. On the contrary,
it is an opinion held by men best able to judge, and
supported by sufficient proof, that, not only have the
various tribes their fixed boundaries of hunting-ground,
which they cannot cross without the risk of a quarrel
with their neighbours, but that even individual persons
possess property of this nature, which is handed down,
according to certain laws, from father to son. A curious
example of this strictness about property, exceeding
even the ideas of Europeans upon the subject, was found
upon the banks of the river Darling, where different
tribes occupy different portions of the stream whence all
equally derive the chief part of their subsistence. One
of these tribes desired Major Mitchell&#8217;s men to pour
out the water which they had taken, as if it had belonged
to them, and at the same time they dug a hole in
the ground to receive it, when poured out. Nay, so
strongly are the river chiefs possessed with a notion of
the water being their own, that they have been seen, on
receiving a tomahawk, to point to the stream, signifying
that the strangers were at liberty to take water from it.
Indeed, the main difference between the property of the
native and that of the colonist, consists in the very dissimilar
uses to which the parties apply their possessions.
The one holds his lands for a cattle-run or a farm, the
other employs his in feeding kangaroos or in growing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
wild roots. But both agree in punishing intruders, both
profess alike to esteem the rights of property to be
sacred; and yet how questionable, how opposite to
these professions must the conduct of Europeans seem,
when they fix themselves upon certain spots, without
taking any notice of the vested rights of the former
inhabitants, and then threaten, or even shoot them, if
they are found lingering among their old haunts, upon
their own estates! Or, if no open violence is offered,
&ldquo;the sheep and cattle,&rdquo; to borrow the words of a kind-hearted
traveller, &ldquo;fill the green pastures, where the
kangaroo was accustomed to range until the stranger
came from distant lands, and claimed the soil.&rdquo; The
first inhabitants, unless they remove beyond the limits
of the colony, are hemmed in by the power of the white
population, and deprived of the liberty of wandering at
will through their native wilds, and compelled to seek
shelter in close thickets and rocky fastnesses; where,
however, if they can find a home, they have great difficulty
in finding a subsistence, for their chief support,
the kangaroo, is either destroyed or banished. In 1772,
when the French discoverer, Monsieur Marion, was exploring
Van Dieman&#8217;s Land, he found the coast well
inhabited, as the fires by day and night bore witness,
and on anchoring in Frederic Hendrick&#8217;s Bay, about
thirty men assembled upon the shore. And now, only
seventy years later, what has become of the grandchildren
and descendants of those unfortunate natives?
Let the reply to this inquiry be made in the very words
given in evidence before a Committee of the House of
Commons, in 1838.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;<em>There is not a native in Van Dieman&#8217;s
Land.</em> The last portion that was secured was
sent to a small island called Gun Carriage Island, where
they are maintained at the expense of government, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
I believe some attempts at civilisation have been made.&mdash;There
has been a lingering desire to come back
again; but they have no means of getting back; the
island is some distance from Van Dieman&#8217;s Land; they
are pining away and dying very fast.&mdash;I believe more
than one half of them have died, not from any positive
disease, but from a disease which we know in medicine
under the name of <em>home-sickness</em>, a disease which is very
common to some Europeans, particularly the Swiss soldiers
and the Swiss peasantry: they are known to die
from a disease of the stomach, which comes on entirely
from a desire to return to their country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be difficult for the christian moralist to condemn
altogether the system of colonisation which has
been practised; it cannot be denied that the occupation
of these vast and favoured regions by civilised and
christian nations is, in itself, a highly desirable object;
yet the man of right principles will surely hesitate
before he approves, for the sake of the good that is to
follow, of the evil which has been done. In this instance,
as in many other evils to be seen under the sun,
it is more easy to perceive the mischief, than to point
out the means of avoiding or of remedying it. But, at
least, it may be said, let those who now hold the beautiful
and frequently fertile lands, which once belonged
to the poor and helpless native, beware of having their
hearts lifted up with pride,&mdash;of forgetting themselves or
their God. Past evils are not to be prevented, but
future events are still in their power. The warning and
reasoning of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, (Rom.
xi. 17-24,) although upon quite another subject, are
still not without application here. Nor should the British
colonist ever forget, while he surveys the fruitful
fields which he may now call his own, the emphatic
words of St. Paul: &ldquo;If God spared not the natural
branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>MANNERS AND HABITS OF THE NATIVES.</strong></p>


<p>The shyness which the savages of Australia frequently
exhibit in their first intercourse with Europeans is not
at all surprising; indeed, it is rather remarkable how
soon they get over this feeling, if they are not interfered
with, and no unpleasant occurrences take place. As
Captain Flinders has very justly observed, &ldquo;were we
living in a state of nature, frequently at war with our
neighbours, and ignorant of the existence of any other
nation, on the first arrival of strangers, so different in
complexion and appearance to ourselves, having power
to transport themselves over, and even living upon an
element which to us was impassable,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> the first sensation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
would probably be terror, and the first movement
flight.&rdquo; We should watch these extraordinary people
from our retreats, and if we found ourselves sought out
or pursued by them, their designs would be suspected;
otherwise, upon seeing them quietly engaged in their
own occupations, curiosity would get the better of fear,
and, after observing them more closely, we should ourselves
seek to open a communication. This is precisely
what takes place with the native tribes in New Holland,
when the discoverers conduct themselves prudently, and
no particular cause of offence or dislike occurs. But
where all appears equally strange and suspicious to
them, it cannot be wondered if they often mistake the
meaning of European customs and actions. For example,
when Major Mitchell was desirous of taking the
portrait of a native in Eastern Australia, the terror and
suspicion of the poor creature, at being required to
stand steadily before the artist were such, that, notwithstanding
the power of disguising fear, so remarkable in
the savage race, the stout heart of Cambo was overcome,
and beat visibly; the perspiration streamed from his
breast, and he was about to sink to the ground, when he
at length suddenly darted away; but he speedily returned,
bearing in one hand his club, and in the other
his <em>boomerang</em> or <em>kiley</em>, with which he seemed to gain
just fortitude enough to be able to stand on his legs
until the sketch was finished.</p>

<p>To the observer of human nature it is, indeed, a
curious spectacle to watch the several contrary feelings
and impulses by which the Australian savage is actuated
in his intercourse with the more civilised portions of our
race. Attachment, very strong attachment to his own
customs, and wild roving mode of life,&mdash;admiration of the
evident superiority, the luxury, abundance and comfort,
enjoyed by Europeans,&mdash;doubt and alarm respecting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
final issue of the changes which he sees taking place
before his eyes,&mdash;an increasing taste for many of the
useful or agreeable articles which are to be procured only
from the hands of the strangers,&mdash;these and other similar
feelings alternately sway the mind, and prompt the
actions, of the native of the bush in Australia, so as to
give an appearance of inconsistency, not merely to the
varying conduct of different persons, but frequently to
the behaviour of the very same person at different times.
Sometimes the perplexed savage decidedly prefers his
piece of whale to all the luxuries of English fare;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> at
another time he despises the common food of the bush&mdash;kangaroo
flesh, or fish,&mdash;and presuming upon his usefulness
as a guide, nothing but <em>wheaten flour</em>, at the rate
of two pounds and a half a day, will satisfy his desires.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
One day, fired with a wish to emulate his betters, the
black man assumes the costume of an European, likes
to be close-shaved, wears a white neck-cloth, and means
to become entirely &ldquo;a white fellow.&rdquo; Another day,
wearied with the heat and thraldom of dress, and
tempted by the cool appearance, or stung by the severe
taunts of his brethren in the bush, off he flings his
encumbrances and civilisation, and gladly returns to a
state of nature again.</p>

<p>The barber&#8217;s art appears, in several cases, to have
caught the attention of these savages. The following
ridiculous account of an operation of this kind, performed
upon some natives of the country a little southward
of Port Jackson, is given by Flinders. &ldquo;A new
employment arose up on our hands. We had clipped
the hair and beards of the two Botany Bay natives, at
Red Point; and they were showing themselves to the
others, and persuading them to follow their example.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
While, therefore, the powder was drying, I began with
a large pair of scissors to execute my new office upon
the eldest of four or five chins presented to me; and as
great nicety was not required, the shearing of a dozen
of them did not occupy me long. Some of the more
timid were alarmed at a formidable instrument coming
so near to their noses, and would scarcely be persuaded
by their shaven friends to allow the operation to be
finished. But when their chins were held up a second
time, their fear of the instrument, the wild stare of their
eyes, and the smile which they <em>forced</em>, formed a compound
upon the rough savage countenance, not unworthy
the pencil of a Hogarth. I was almost tempted to try
what effect a little snip would produce, but our situation
was too critical to admit of such experiments.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It has been repeatedly stated, upon good authority,
that the health of the natives of the bush has suffered
greatly, and that their lives have been frequently shortened,
by the habits and indulgences which they have
learned from their more civilized neighbours. In their
original state, although beyond question the average
duration of life was considerably below that of European
nations, yet an advanced age was not uncommonly
attained among them. Numbers die during the period
of infancy, for none except very strong children can
possibly undergo the hardships, the privations, and the
perpetual travelling, which most of the infants born in
the bush must brave and endure. Besides which, there
is the chance of a violent death in some of the frequent
quarrels which arise and include in their consequences
all the relatives of the contending parties. But, due
allowance having been made for these causes by which
the average duration of life in those wild regions is
shortened, it does not appear that their inhabitants are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a particularly short-lived race, although by some persons
this has been thought to be the case. It is impossible
exactly to ascertain the age of the Australian savages, who
have no mode of keeping account of this themselves; but
from instances of youths, their father, grandfather, and
great uncle being alive, and in the enjoyment of tolerably
good health, or from similar cases, it may be safely concluded
that they frequently reach, or even pass beyond,
the boundary term of life, three score years and ten. To
one horrible mode of departing from life, which is
strangely common in more polished nations, these barbarians
are, happily, strangers. Captain Grey says,
&ldquo;I believe they have no idea that such a thing as
a man&#8217;s putting an end to his own life could ever
occur; whenever I have questioned them on this point,
they have invariably laughed at me, and treated my
question as a joke.&rdquo; The period of old age must be as
happy as any other time in the life of a savage, if not
more so, since aged men are always treated with much
respect, and rarely take an active part in any fray. They
are allowed to marry young wives, and to watch them
as jealously, and treat them as cruelly, as they please;
and they appear to suffer less from weakness and
disease than the aged amongst us usually endure. The
old, too, are privileged to eat certain kinds of meat forbidden
to the young. Thus Piper, a native, who accompanied
Major Mitchell, would not eat the flesh of emu,
even when food was scarce; but when he had undergone
the ceremony of being rubbed over with the fat of that
bird by an old man, he had thenceforth no objection to
it. The threatened penalty was, that young men, after
eating it, would be afflicted with sores all over the body;
but the fact is, that it is too rich and oily for the old men
to allow any but themselves to partake of it. So that,
upon the whole, in New Holland, as in most other uncivilised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
countries, old age is a period of much dignity,
and of considerable enjoyment of life.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the troubles, or whatever the
enjoyments, of old age, they are, in their very nature,
even above our other troubles or enjoyments, brief and
transitory. The aged warrior of Australia can plead no
exemption from the common lot of mortality, and death
draws a veil over the chequered existence,&mdash;the faults
and follies, the talents and virtues, of every child of
Adam. The various customs and superstitions, connected
with the death and burial of their friends, are
very numerous among the tribes of Australia, and some
of them are curious and peculiar. It would be impossible
to give a full account of them, but a few of the most
remarkable may be selected. Throughout all the funeral
solemnities of savage and heathen nations the same
distinguishing mark is to be observed,&mdash;they are the
vain devices, the miserable inventions of men who sorrow
for their departed friends as those that have no hope.
Nothing, it is asserted, can awake in the breast more
melancholy feelings than the funeral chants of the Australians.
They are sung by a whole chorus of females of
all ages, and the effect produced upon the bystanders by
this wild music surpasses belief. The following is a chant,
which has been heard upon several such occasions, and
which, simple though it be, fully expresses the feelings of
a benighted heathen mourning over the grave of a friend
whom he has lost (as he thinks) for ever:&mdash;</p>

<p>But previously to our entering upon the subject of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the funeral rites practised in New Holland, it will be
necessary to notice the superstitions respecting sorcerers,
which in that country are so intimately connected with
the very idea of death. When an individual life is taken
away by open violence, then, as we have seen, it is
avenged upon the supposed murderer, or his relatives.
But when death occurs from accidental or natural
causes, it is usually attributed to the influence of sorcery,
and not unfrequently is it revenged upon some connexion
of the parties believed to have practised that art.
So that, generally speaking, the death of one human
being involves that of another, which is no small check
to population. In truth, it would almost seem that the
natives have no idea of death occurring, except by
violence or sorcery;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and these strange notions must
not be dealt with too severely, in a country like England,
where (within the last 200 years, and in no
uncivilised state of society) persons have been burnt
for witchcraft; and in which, even in the present day,
every vile imposture and godless pretence of supernatural
power is sure of finding eager listeners and
astonished admirers. The <em>Boyl-yas</em>, or native sorcerers,
are objects of mysterious dread, and are thought to have
the power of becoming invisible to all eyes but those of
their brethren in the same evil craft. As our northern
witches were supposed to have the power of riding upon
a broom-stick, so these southern sorcerers are said to be
able to transport themselves at pleasure through the
air. If they have a dislike to any one they can kill
him, it is said, by stealing on him at night and consuming
his flesh, into which they enter like pieces of
quartz-stone, and the pain they occasion is always felt.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Another sorcerer, however, can draw them out, and
the pieces of stone pretended to be thus obtained are
kept as great curiosities. Perhaps the clearest ideas
of the imaginary powers of these sorcerers, and of
the dread in which they are held, will be found from
the following account, obtained from a native with the
utmost difficulty, (for the subject is never willingly
mentioned,) and reported <em>verbatim</em> by Captain Grey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The <em>Boyl-yas</em>,&rsquo; said the trembling Kaiber, &lsquo;are natives
who have the power of <em>boyl-ya</em>; they sit down to
the northward, the eastward, and southward; the <em>Boyl-yas</em>
are very bad, they walk away there&rsquo; (pointing to
the east). &lsquo;I shall be very ill presently. The <em>Boyl-yas</em>
eat up a great many natives,&mdash;they eat them up as fire
would; you and I will be very ill directly. The <em>Boyl-yas</em>
have ears: by and by they will be greatly enraged. I&#8217;ll
tell you no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The <em>Boyl-yas</em> move stealthily,&mdash;you sleep and they
steal on you,&mdash;very stealthily the <em>Boyl-yas</em> move. These
<em>Boyl-yas</em> are dreadfully revengeful; by and by we shall
be very ill. I&#8217;ll not talk about them. They come moving
along in the sky,&mdash;cannot you let them alone? I&#8217;ve
already a terrible headache; by and by you and I will
be two dead men.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The natives cannot see them. The <em>Boyl-yas</em> do not
bite, they feed stealthily; they do not eat the bones, but
consume the flesh. Just give me what you intend to
give, and I&#8217;ll walk off.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
What secrets can the human breast contain,<br />
When tempted by thy charms, curst love of gain!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The <em>Boyl-yas</em> sit at the graves of natives in great
numbers. If natives are ill, the <em>Boyl-yas</em> charm, charm,
charm, charm, and charm, and, by and by, the natives
recover.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Nothing further could be learned from this terrified
and unwilling witness. The custom spoken of in the
last part of his evidence, that of sitting at the graves of
the dead, is found in nearly all the known portions of
Australia, and the object of this practice is to discover
by what person the death of the deceased individual has
been caused, which is supposed to be declared by dreams
or visions. A similar custom among the Jews is reproved
by the prophet Isaiah, chap. lxv. 4, 5.</p>

<p>Once, when Major Mitchell had been harassed, and
two of his party killed by the hostile natives, he reached
a spot of security, where, while admiring the calm repose
of the wild landscape, and the beauteous beams of the
setting sun, he was anticipating a night free from disturbance.
He was alone, waiting the arrival of his
party, but his reveries were dissipated in the most
soothing manner, by the soft sounds of a female voice,
singing in a very different tone from that generally prevailing
among the Australians. It sounded like the song
of despair, and, indeed, it was the strain of a female
mourning over some deceased relative; nor could the
loud &ldquo;hurra&rdquo; of the men, when they came up, angry at
the recent pillage and murder of some of the party, put
to flight the melancholy songstress of the woods. On
these occasions it is usual for the relatives of the deceased
to continue their lamentations, appearing insensible
of what people may be doing around them.</p>

<p>The rude verses, given below, and forming the substance
of a chant, sung by an old woman to incite the
men to avenge the death of a young person, may serve
at once for a specimen of the poetry and superstition of
the Australian wilderness:&mdash;</p>

 Woe to him who cannot leap!<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Woe to him who has bad eyes!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>When an old woman has commenced a chant of this
kind, she will continue it until she becomes positively
exhausted; and upon her ceasing, another takes up the
song. The effect some of them have upon the assembled
men is very great; indeed, it is said that these addresses
of the old women are the cause of most of the disturbances
which take place. Thus, even amid the forests of
New Holland, the <em>influence of woman</em> will, in one way or
another, make itself felt.</p>

<p>The ceremonies observed at the funeral of a native
vary, as might be expected, in so great a space, but they
are wild and impressive in every part of New Holland.
According to Collins, the natives of the colony called New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
South Wales were in the habit of burning the bodies of
those who had passed the middle age of life, but burial
seems the more universal method of disposing of their
dead among the Australians. Some very curious drawings
and figures cut in the rock were discovered by
Captain Grey, in North-Western Australia, but whether
these were burying-places does not appear. For the
account of these works of rude art, which is extremely
interesting, but too long to transcribe, the reader is
referred to the delightful work of the traveller just
mentioned.</p>

<p>The shrieks and piercing cries uttered by the women
over their dead relatives, are said to be truly fearful, and
agreeably to the ancient custom of idolatrous eastern
nations mentioned in 1 Kings xviii. 28, and in Jer. xlviii.
37,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> they tear and lacerate themselves most frightfully,
occasionally cutting off portions of their beards, and,
having singed them, throwing them upon the dead body.
With respect to their tombs, these are of various sorts
in different districts. In the gulph of Carpentaria, on
the Northern coast, Flinders found several skeletons of
natives, standing upright in the hollow trunks of trees;
the skulls and bones, being smeared or painted partly
red and partly white, made a very strange appearance.
On the banks of the river Darling, in the interior of
Eastern Australia, Major Mitchell fell in with a tribe,
which had evidently suffered greatly from small-pox,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
some similar disease, and in the same neighbourhood he
met with some remarkable mounds or tombs, supposed
to cover the remains of that portion of the tribe which
had been swept off by the same disease that had left its
marks upon the survivors. On a small hill, overlooking
the river, were three large tombs, of an oval shape, and
about twelve feet across in the longest diameter. Each
stood in the centre of an artificial hollow, the mound in
the middle being about five feet high; and on each of
them were piled numerous withered branches and limbs
of trees, forming no unsuitable emblems of mortality.
There were no trees on this hill, save one quite dead,
which seemed to point with its hoary arms, like a spectre,
to the tombs. A melancholy waste, where a level
country and boundless woods extended beyond the
reach of vision, was in perfect harmony with the dreary
foreground of the scene.</p>

<p>Indeed, to those who have been from infancy accustomed
to the quiet consecrated burying places of our
own land,&mdash;spots which, in rural districts, are usually
retired, yet not quite removed from the reach of &ldquo;the
busy hum of men;&rdquo; to those who have always looked
upon a Christian temple,</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;Whose taper spire points, finger-like, to heaven,&rdquo;</p>

<p>as the almost necessary accompaniment of a burial-place,
the appearance of the native tombs in the desolate wilds
of a savage and uncultivated country, must be dreary in
the extreme. Scenes of this character must appear to
the eye of a Christian almost emblematical of the
spiritual blank&mdash;the absence of any sure and certain
hope&mdash;in the midst of which the natives, whose remains
are there reposing, must have lived and died. How
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
striking is Captain Grey&#8217;s description of another tomb,
which was found in a totally different part of New
Holland, near the western coast, and at no great distance
from the Swan River settlement! The scenery, not,
indeed, in the immediate vicinity, but very near to the
newly-made grave, is thus described. Even at mid-day,
the forest wore a sombre aspect, and a stillness and
solitude reigned throughout it that were very striking.
Occasionally, a timid kangaroo might be seen stealing
off in the distance, or a kangaroo-rat might dart out
from a tuft beneath your feet, but these were rare
circumstances. The most usual disturbers of these wooded
solitudes were the black cockatoos; &ldquo;but I have never,
in any part of the world,&rdquo; adds the enterprising traveller,
&ldquo;seen so great a want of animal life as in these
mountains.&rdquo; It was not far from this lonely district, in
a country nearly resembling it, only less wooded and
more broken into deep valleys, that a recent grave was
found, carefully constructed, with a hut built over it, to
protect the now senseless slumberer beneath from the
rains of winter. All that friendship could do to render
his future state happy had been done. His throwing-stick
was stuck in the ground at his head; his broken
spears rested against the entrance of the hut; the grave
was thickly strewed with <em>wilgey</em>, or red earth; and
three trees in front of the hut, chopped with a variety
of notches and uncouth figures, bore testimony that his
death had been bloodily avenged. The native Kaiber,
who acted as guide to the travellers, gazed upon this
scene with concern and uneasiness. Being asked why
the spears were broken, the trees notched, and the red
earth strewed upon the grave, his reply was, &ldquo;Neither
you nor I know: our people have always done so, and
we do so now,&rdquo;&mdash;quite as good a reason as many who
think themselves far more enlightened are able to give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
for their actions. When a proposal was made to stop
for the night at this solitary spot, poor Kaiber resisted
it; &ldquo;I cannot rest here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for there are many
spirits in this place.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>When Mr. Montgomery Martin was in Australia, he
obtained with some difficulty the dead body of an old
woman, who had long been known about Sydney. Hearing
of her death and burial in the forest, about twenty-five
miles from his residence, he went thither, and aided
by some stock-keepers, found the grave,&mdash;a slightly elevated
and nearly circular mound. The body was buried
six feet deep, wrapped in several sheets of bark, the
inner one being of a fine silvery texture. Several things
which the deceased possessed in life, together with her
favourite dog, were buried with her,&mdash;all apparently for
use in another world. The skull of this poor creature
was full of indentations, as if a tin vessel had been struck
by a hammer; light might be seen through these hollows,
which had been caused by blows of <em>whaddies</em> (hard
sticks) when she was young, and some bold youths
among the natives courted her after this strange fashion.
It seemed scarcely possible that marks so extraordinary
could have been made in the human skull without fracturing
it.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>In a society of men so simple and so little advanced
in refinement or civilisation as the inhabitants of New
Holland, it is evident that their wants must be few and
easily satisfied, their stock of earthly riches very small
and humble. Indeed, these people nearly always carry
the whole of their worldly property about with them,
and the Australian hunter is thus equipped: round his
middle is wound a belt spun from the fur of the opossum,
in which are stuck his hatchet, his <em>kiley</em> or <em>boomerang</em>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and a short heavy stick to throw at the smaller animals.
In his hand he carries his throwing-stick, and several
spears, headed in two or three different manners, so that
they are equally suitable to war or the chase. In the
southern parts, a warm kangaroo-skin cloak, thrown
over his shoulders, completes the hunter&#8217;s outfit; but
this is seldom or never seen northwards of 29&deg; south latitude.
These, however, are not quite all the riches of
the barbarian, a portion of which is carried by his wife,
or wives, as the case may be; and each of these has a
long thick stick, with its point hardened in the fire, a
child or two fixed upon their shoulders, and in their
bags, in which also they keep sundry other articles,
reckoned valuable and important for the comfort of
savage life. For example; a flat stone to pound roots
with, and earth to mix with the pounded roots;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> quartz,
for making spears and knives; stones, for hatchets;
gum, for making and mending weapons and tools; kangaroo
sinews for thread, and the shin-bones of the same
animal for needles;&mdash;these and many similar articles,
together with whatever roots, &amp;c. they may have collected
during the day, form the total of the burden of a
female Australian; and this, together with the husband&#8217;s
goods, forms the sum and substance of the wealth of an
inhabitant of the southern land. In Wellesley&#8217;s Islands,
on the north coast of New Holland, the catalogue of
a native&#8217;s riches appears somewhat different, from his
maritime position.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> A raft, made of several straight
branches of mangrove lashed together, broader at one
end than at the other;&mdash;a bunch of grass at the broad
end where the man sits to paddle,&mdash;a short net to catch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
turtle, or probably a young shark,&mdash;and their spears and
paddles seem to form the whole earthly riches of these
rude fishermen.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But one essential thing must not be
overlooked in the enumeration of a native&#8217;s possessions.
Fire, of procuring which they have not very easy means,
is usually carried about with them; and the women
commonly have the charge of the lighted stick, in addition
to their other cares.</p>

<p>It is no very easy matter for civilized man to realise
the perfectly free and unencumbered way in which these
natives roam from place to place, accordingly as seasons
or provisions may serve, constantly carrying with them
a home wherever they go; and (what is far more difficult
in civilised society) leaving no cares of home behind
them in the spot from which they may have recently
removed. Certainly there must be something very delightful
in this wild sort of life to every one, who has
from his early infancy been accustomed to its pleasure
and inured to its hardships, neither of which are by any
means to be measured by the standard of the cold and
changeable climate of England. The grand objects of
the savage, in almost every part of the globe, are to
baffle his human enemies, and to assert his dominion
over the lower races of animals. For these purposes,
the activity, secrecy, acuteness, and sagacity of man in an
uncivilised state are almost incredible; nor could we
have supposed, were not the truth shown in numberless
instances, that the senses of human beings were capable
of so great perfection, their bodies and limbs of such
exertion and agility, as they gain by continual practice
and early training in the forests of America or Australia.
In these bodily excellencies, the inhabitants of the last-named
continent might safely challenge the whole world
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to surpass them. The natives once approached Major
Mitchell&#8217;s camp by night; and though nine fire-sticks
were seen in motion, no noise was heard. At length
when the lights had approached within 150 yards, every
one suddenly disappeared; the bearers preserving, all
the while, the most perfect silence. It was then thought
advisable to scare these noiseless visitors away, and a
rocket was sent up, at which signal the English party
rushed forward with a shout; and this had the desired
effect. It is said that the natives regard, as an important
matter, the falling of a star, which would account
for their alarm at the rocket. On another occasion, when
an English exploring party had discovered a few traces of
natives near their place of encampment, an active search
after them immediately took place; and it appeared that
they had crept up within about one hundred yards
of the camp, after which they had been disturbed, and
had made off. Their mode of approach was by a stream
of water, so as to conceal their trail; after which they
had turned out of the stream up its right bank, and had
carefully trod in one another&#8217;s footmarks, so as to conceal
their number, although traces of six or seven different
men could be perceived as far as the spot where
they had been disturbed. From this point these children
of the Bush had disappeared, as it were, by magic:
not a twig was broken, not a stone was turned, nor
could it be observed that the heavy drops of rain had
been shaken from a single blade of grass. All efforts to
hit upon the direction in which they had fled were to
no purpose, except to put the explorers more constantly
on the watch against beings who were often near them
when they least dreamed of their presence. Human
wisdom would enforce this lesson from such circumstances;
but how often does heavenly wisdom lift up
its voice to us in vain, teaching us by what is passing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
around us to be upon our watch constantly over our
own conduct, since we are never very far from the Almighty
presence of God himself!</p>

<p>To the quick-sighted natives, the surface of the earth
is, in fact, as legible as a newspaper, so accustomed are
they to read in any traces left upon it the events of the
day.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> For once, Major Mitchell informs us, he was able
to hide so that these people could not find; but then his
buried treasure was only a collection of specimens of
stones and minerals, of the use of which they could
know nothing, and concerning which they were little
likely to have any suspicions. The notes written by
the traveller, and concealed in trees, seldom escaped
notice;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> nor did provisions, nor, in short, any article
which they could either use or suspect pass unobserved.</p>

<p>In Western Australia, Captain Grey, having galloped
after some wild cattle which he had met in his journey,
found, upon wishing to ascertain the hour, that his watch
had fallen from his pocket during the chase. He waited
until the rest of his party came up, and then requested
Kaiber, their native guide, to walk back and find the
watch. This, Kaiber assured the traveller, was utterly
impossible, nor could his assertion be gainsaid; nevertheless,
the watch was too valuable to be given up without
an effort for its recovery. &ldquo;Well, Kaiber,&rdquo; said the
captain, &ldquo;your people had told me you could see tracks
well, but I find they are mistaken; you have but one
eye,&mdash;something is the matter with the other,&rdquo; (this was
really the case)&mdash;&ldquo;no young woman will have you, for if
you cannot follow my tracks, and find a watch, how can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
you kill game for her?&rdquo; This speech had the desired
effect, and the promise of a shilling heightened his diligence,
so they went back together in search of the lost
article. The ground that had been passed over was
badly suited for the purpose of tracking, and the scrub
was thick; nevertheless, to his delight and surprise, the
captain had his watch restored to his pocket in less than
half an hour.</p>

<p>Even in the simple arts and rude habits of the people
of New Holland there are different degrees of advancement
and progress to be observed. On the west coast,
a few degrees to the north of the British settlement at
Swan River, a great difference was noticed by Captain
Grey in the arrangements of the native population.
The country near the Hutt River is exceedingly beautiful
and fertile, and it supports a very numerous population,
comparatively with other districts. The exploring
party found a native path or road, wider, more used, and
altogether better than any before seen in that region.
Along the side of this path were seen frequent wells,
some of them ten or twelve feet in depth, which were
made in a superior manner. Across the dry bed of a
stream they then came upon a light fruitful soil, which
served the inhabitants as a <em>warran</em> ground. <em>Warran</em> is a
sort of <em>yam</em> like the sweet potato, and its root is a
favourite article of food with some of the native tribes.
For three miles and a half the travellers passed over a
fertile tract of land full of the holes made by the natives
in digging this root; indeed, so thick were they, that it
was not easy to walk, and this tract extended east and
west, as far as they could see. The district must have
been inhabited a great many years, for more had been
done in it to secure a provision from the ground by hard
manual labour than it would have appeared to be in the
power of uncivilised man to accomplish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
It can be no subject of surprise that the various tribes
of Australia, living in a wild country, and blessed with
no clear nor adequate ideas of their Maker, should be
exceedingly superstitious, as well as ignorant and simple.
The strange aversion felt by some of them to a sort of
muscle or oyster, found in fresh water, has already been
mentioned; and the horror of the native population at
the supposed effects of sorcery has also been detailed.
Kaiber, Captain Grey&#8217;s guide, was bidden to gather
a few of these muscles to make a meal for the party of
hungry travellers in the Bush, but at first he would not
move, declaring that if he touched these shell-fish, the
<em>Boyl-yas</em> would be the death of him. Unable to bring
any instance of mischief arising from them, he shrewdly
answered, that this was because nobody had been
&ldquo;wooden-headed&rdquo; enough to meddle with them, and
that he intended to have nothing whatever to do with
them. At last, with much difficulty he was prevailed to
go, but whilst occupied in his task, he was heard most
bitterly deploring his fate. It was his courage and
strong sinews, he said, that had hitherto kept him from
dying either of hunger or thirst, but what would these
avail him against the power of sorcery? However, the
muscles were brought, and Kaiber&#8217;s master made his
meal upon them, but no persuasions could prevail upon
him to partake of them. The same evening, the half-starved,
half-clothed party of travellers were overtaken
by a tremendous storm, which put out their fires, and
they continued during the night in a most pitiable state
from exposure to the cold and weather. All these misfortunes
were set down by the sagacious native to the
account of the muscles, nor was it till his master
threatened him with a good beating, that Kaiber left off
chattering to himself, while his mouth moved with the
effect of the extreme cold:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Oh, wherefore did he eat the muscles?</span><br />
 Now the <em>Boyl-yas</em> storms and thunder make;<br />
 Oh, wherefore would he eat the muscles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the superstitions of Australia, that feeling of
awe which revolts from mentioning even the name of a
deceased person is very remarkable; and the custom of
silence upon this subject is so strictly enforced, that it
renders inquiry respecting the family or ancestors of a
native extremely difficult.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The only circumstance
enabling the inquirer to overcome this hindrance is the
fact, that, the longer a person has been dead, the less
unwilling do they appear to name him. Thus did
Captain Grey obtain some curious information respecting
their pedigrees and family customs; for he began
with endeavouring to discover only the oldest names on
record, and then, as opportunity served, he would contrive
to fill up the blanks, sometimes, when they were
assembled round their fires at night, encouraging little
disputes among them concerning their forefathers, by
means of which he was able to gain much of the information
he wanted.</p>

<p>One very singular notion prevailing among the native
population of Australia, and proving that the belief in a
spiritual world and in a future state, is not quite extinct
even among them, is the idea which they entertain of
white people being the souls of departed blacks. This
supposition may serve to explain the reason of the disagreeable
process complained of by Sturt, who says,
that every new tribe examined them, pulling them
about, measuring the hands and feet of the strangers
with their own, counting their fingers, feeling their faces,
and besmearing them all over with dirt and grease. A
more powerful feeling than curiosity even may have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
prompted this conduct, and they may have sought, impelled
by superstition, to recognise in the foreigners
their own kindred. But however that may have been,
most travellers in Australia mention the peculiar idea
alluded to. Captain Grey was once vehemently attacked
by the caresses of an old, ugly, and dirty black woman,
who recognised him as her son&#8217;s ghost, and was obliged
to endure them. His real mother, the captain says,
could scarcely have expressed more delight at his return,
while his sable-coloured brothers and sister paid their
respects to him, when the vehemence of a mother&#8217;s
affection had somewhat subsided. He was convinced
that the old woman really believed him to be her son,
whose first thought, upon his return to earth, had been
to revisit his old mother, and bring her a present!</p>

<p>The natives believe that the <em>night-mare</em>&mdash;a subject
likely enough to give birth to superstition&mdash;is caused
by some evil spirit, in order to get rid of which they
jump up, seize a lighted brand from the fire, and, after
whirling it round the head with a variety of imprecations,
they throw the stick away in the direction where
they suppose the evil spirit to be. They say the demon
wants a light, and that when he gets it, he will go away.
However, besides supplying this his need, they likewise
take the precautions of changing their position, and of
getting as near as they can into the middle of the group
of their companions who are sleeping round the fire. If
obliged to move away from the fire after dark, either to
get water or for any other purpose, they carry a light
with them, and set fire to dry bushes as they go along.</p>

<p>A profound respect, almost amounting to veneration, is
paid in many districts of Australia to shining stones or
pieces of crystal, which they call &ldquo;<em>Teyl</em>.&rdquo; These are
carried in the girdles of men, especially of the sorcerers
or <em>corad-jes</em>, and no woman is allowed to see the contents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the round balls made of woollen cord from the fur
of the opossum in which these crystals are enclosed.
They are employed as charms in sickness, and are sometimes
sent from tribe to tribe for hundreds of miles on
the sea-coast or in the interior. One of these stones,
which was examined by an Englishman, to whom it was
shown privately by a black, was of a substance like
quartz, about the size of a pigeon&#8217;s egg, and transparent,
like white sugar-candy. The small particles of crystal
which crumble off are swallowed in order to prevent
illness. Many other instances of the like superstitious
folly might very easily be gathered from the writings of
those who have had the best opportunities of becoming
acquainted with the manners of the Australian tribes.</p>

<p>The following is from the pen of the Rev. G. King, a
missionary of the Society for Propagating the Gospel,
who speaks thus of the natives near Fremantle, in
Western Australia: &ldquo;The native children are intelligent
and apt to learn, but the advanced men are so far removed
from civilisation, and so thoroughly confirmed in
roving habits, that all the exertions made in their behalf
have found them totally inaccessible; but we have no
reason to conclude that they have not a vague idea of a
future state. They are exceedingly superstitious; they
never venture out of their huts from sunset till sunrise,
for fear of encountering goblins and evil spirits. When
any of their tribe dies they say, &lsquo;He&#8217;ll soon jump up,
white man, and come back again in big ship;&rsquo; and when
a stranger arrives, they examine his countenance minutely,
to trace the lineaments of some deceased friend;
and when they think they have discovered him they
sometimes request him to expose his breast, that they
may see where the spear entered which caused the life to
fly away so long.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Altogether, experience bears witness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in their case, of the same fact which is to be perceived
in other parts of the globe, namely, that where
there is little religion, there is often a great deal of
superstition, and that those who do not &ldquo;believe the
truth,&rdquo; almost always fall into the snares of falsehood,
so as to &ldquo;believe a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all the disadvantages of having two races of
men (one of which is thought inferior to the other) occupying
the same territory; with the evils, likewise,
unavoidably arising from the ease with which what is
<em>bad</em> in Europeans may be learned and copied, and the
difficulty of understanding or imitating what is <em>good</em> in
us, the natives are placed in a very peculiar and unhappy
situation. Their intercourse with the white men
has hitherto, certainly, been productive of more injury,
both moral and temporal, than benefit to them. Into
the sad and disgusting details, affording a proof of this
truth, which may be found in the evidence before the
committees of the House of Commons upon the subject
of transportation it will neither be suitable nor possible
to enter. The fact is, indeed, acknowledged by
men of all parties and opinions, while, by all right-minded
men, it is deeply deplored.</p>

<p>Drunkenness and its attendant vices prevail to a
fearful extent among the Europeans in New Holland,
the lower orders especially; and what sins are more
enticing than these to the ignorant, sensual savage?
Tobacco and spirits, which the poor natives call &ldquo;<em>tumbledown</em>,&rdquo;
are articles in constant request; and to purchase
these of Europeans, the blacks will give almost anything
they possess, even their wives.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Thus, a regular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
traffic in what is evil is carried on, and almost all that
the heathen people of Australia learn from the so-called
Christians with whom they associate, is to practise, with
tenfold aggravation, sins which God abhors, and will
not allow to go unpunished. Like children that have
been always brought up in a family of foul-tongued
transgressors, the very first words of English which the
natives learn are words of wickedness and blasphemy;
the only introduction to the name of their God and
Saviour is in order that they may insult that holy Name,
and blaspheme the Divine Majesty. And these lessons
are taught them, let us remember, by men calling themselves,
and perhaps even thinking themselves, civilised,
enlightened, and Christian persons;&mdash;by men, certainly,
belonging to a nation, which justly lays claim to these
honourable epithets! But enough has been stated on
this painful subject to fill every thoughtful mind with
humiliation and fear, when it contemplates the &ldquo;much&rdquo;
that &ldquo;has been given&rdquo; to civilised nations, and recalls
the fixed rule of truth and justice, that so much the
&ldquo;more&rdquo; will be required of them. Nor is this a matter
concerning the British inhabitants of the colonies alone,
and with which the nation at large has little or no concern.
For if we inquire, who corrupt the natives? the
answer is, our vile and worthless population, the very
scum of mankind, whom we have cast out as evil from
the bosom of their native land. But a further question
naturally offers itself. Who were, in many instances,
the passive, if not the active, corrupters of these very
corrupters themselves? Who have neglected to provide
means for their christian instruction, and so let them
grow up to be worse than heathens, until they could be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
endured no longer in the land? What nation had within
a single century more than doubled its population without
having built or endowed a score of new churches?
To whose neglect is it, partly, though not entirely, owing,
that when heathens meet, in far distant countries, with
our lower classes, or when their homes are visited in our
great towns and cities, the very heathens are sometimes
forced to yield the palm to them in wickedness and in
sin? Such questions very nearly concern every Englishman,
and they are, even now, only beginning to command
the attention they deserve. High and low, rich
and poor, clergy and laity, we are all alike implicated in
those evils, which have arisen from national neglect and
forgetfulness of God, and which are not unlikely to lead
to national confusion and ruin. But we are still, thank
God, blessed with a pure and apostolical Church in our
native country, and this is a mighty instrument for good,
if we will but support it, and render it as efficient as it
ought to be. The children of our little sea-girt isle may
almost be called the salt of the earth, so extensively is
our naval and our moral power spread. If we can bring
those children up in the right way, as dutiful children
of God and faithful members of the Church of England,
then, indeed, the blessings resulting from our efforts
may make themselves felt in the very ends of the earth&mdash;in
the solitary wilds of New Holland. But otherwise,
if we continue to neglect our own people, and disgrace
our profession of Christianity by encouraging tacitly the
growth of heathenism around us, then we may judge
by the moral and social evils which have already resulted
from this course what the final consequences
are likely to be. &ldquo;If the salt have lost its savour
wherewith shall it be salted: it is therefore good for
nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of
men.&rdquo; (Matt. v. 13.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
With savages resembling those that dwell in the
Australian forests, having no means of religious instruction
among themselves, the only hope of producing
an improvement in their moral and social character,
must arise from their intercourse with christian people.
But it must be repeated, unhappily, the great majority
of <em>christian</em> people (especially in that country and
among those classes where the native is most likely
to have intercourse) are by no means adorning by their
lives the faith and doctrine of that Master whose
name they bear. Hence arises the deplorable condition
of the natives, who are brought into contact chiefly with
the lowest and worst of the Europeans, and who, beside
many other hindrances, have the great stumbling-block
of bad examples, and evil lives, constantly before them
in their intercourse with the Christians. And, as though
that were not enough, as though fresh obstacles to the
conversion of these nations to God&#8217;s truth were needed
and required, our holy religion is presented to them, not
as it came from the hands of its Founder and his Apostles,
inculcating &ldquo;one Lord, one faith, and one baptism,&rdquo;
but such as man&#8217;s weakness and wickedness delight in
representing it,&mdash;a strange jumble of various &ldquo;denominations.&rdquo;
And this unworthy course has been followed
by government itself. Without any pleas arising from
<em>conscience</em>, or the principle of <em>toleration</em> to excuse this,
the British government, in what little they have done
for converting to Christianity some of the natives, have
afforded their help to bodies of Christians bearing
different names. Nor can it be said that the Church of
England and Ireland was without any zealous ministers
ready to undertake this most difficult task, trusting in
God&#8217;s strength for help to accomplish it, at least in some
degree. It is the confession of Dr. Lang himself, who
is no friend to the Church of England, that the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
two missions<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> to the natives existing in 1837 were, as all
ought to be, episcopalian; but one of these was stated,
on the best authority, in 1841 to be &ldquo;not in an encouraging
state,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> although a third mission, to belong
to the Presbyterians, was about to be commenced <em>under
the auspices of Government</em>, among the natives in another
station. It is fearlessly asserted that <em>all</em> missions to
the heathen supported by Government ought to be
subject to episcopal control; and the reasons for this
may be briefly added. First, there is no tenderness of
conscience, nor claim to toleration, which can stand in
the way of an English government spreading among its
native subjects the doctrine and discipline of the
English Church; supposing these willing to become
Christians at all, they cannot have a prior claim upon us
to be brought up as <em>dissenters</em> from the Church. Secondly,
since the Scotch discipline, though it prevails over a
very small part of our population, is yet established by
law in one portion of the island, it may put in (as it
has done) its claim for help from Government; but,
without entering into argument respecting this, might
we not safely put it to every wise and rightly judging
Presbyterian, whether it is not better to waive this
claim of theirs, than to perplex the progress of Christianity,
by offering to the heathen Australians, at the
same time, and by the same temporal authority, the
Bible, which speaks of <em>one</em> Church, and the choice
between <em>two</em> churches? And lastly, whatever unhappy
scruples and divisions among Christians have arisen
respecting episcopacy, surely, if men had a truly
christian spirit within them, they would quietly consent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to the instruction of the natives being placed in the
hands of a Church which they cannot deny to be
scriptural, and of a ministry, which for 1500 years from
Christ&#8217;s birth no sect of men ever thought of denying
to be the only apostolical ministry. It is indeed a
strange spectacle which our Christianity must offer to
the eyes of those that are really desirous of becoming
converts. Either we &ldquo;bite and devour one another,&rdquo;
or else we quietly set aside our Lord&#8217;s commands and
prayers for our union, and contentedly agree to divide
ourselves into as many parties, sects, or denominations,
as we please; and having done so, we go and inoculate
our heathen converts with our own love of separation.
St. Paul was shocked at hearing of divisions in the
Church of Corinth, but enlightened statesmen of the
nineteenth century appear to be shocked at the idea of
allowing Christianity to be offered to the heathens without
its unhappy divisions! What, it may be asked with
all reverence, would have been the success of the
Apostles in evangelizing the Gentile world, if the gospel
of Christ had been offered to the heathens of that age,
under the same disadvantages with which men of the
present age prefer to clog and impede their missionary
efforts? Can we wonder, under these circumstances, at
the slow progress of the gospel? Is it not rather
wonderful that it should make any progress at all? If
the world is reluctant to believe in Christ&#8217;s mission,
would not His own words, (John xvii. 21,) suggest to
us our miserable divisions as a chief cause of this?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>SKETCHES OF NATIVE CHARACTER.</strong></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bennillong.</span>&mdash;The
first native who could be persuaded
to live upon friendly terms of confidence with the British
settlers in New South Wales was called Bennillong, and
it was after no very long period, (within two years
after the commencement of the colony,) that this intercourse
with them began in the following manner:&mdash;In
the spring of the second year the bodies of many of the
natives were found in a lifeless or dying state upon
different parts of the coast near Sydney, in consequence
of the small-pox, which had been raging among them; and
some of these having been brought up to the settlement,
from motives of pity, the disease was taken by a native
who had been captured shortly before, in hopes of
opening through him a means of communication with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the others. The intended interpreter died, but the
governor, Captain Philip, still retained in his care two
native children, whose lives had been saved from the
small-pox, and succeeded, within a few months, in
securing two other natives, both of them well known to
the children, through whom they were assured of perfect
safety. However, instead of remaining until they
could become familiar with the English manners and
language, so as to carry on an intercourse between the
colonists and their own countrymen, these natives both
made their escape, one of them very soon after he had
been taken; the other, Bennillong, in about six months
afterwards, when he had been treated with every kindness
and indulgence, and had grown somewhat accustomed
to the society of the English settlers. Bennillong
made his escape in May 1790, and in the September
following he saw some of the colonists, by whom he
sent a present to the governor, namely, a piece of the
whale which was then lying on the beach, and around
which the natives were assembled at a feast. Wishing
to see him again, the governor went immediately to the
spot, where he found a number of natives, and both
Bennillong, and the other one, Cole-be, who had first
escaped. All went on amicably at first, and some
wearing apparel, belonging to the men in the boat, was
given to the savages, while Bennillong obtained a promise
from his excellency that more should be brought in
two days, and likewise some hatchets. The governor
and his friends were retiring by degrees to their boat,
having imprudently allowed the natives very nearly to
surround them, when Bennillong, after presenting several
of his friends by name, pointed out one, whom Captain
Philip stepped forward to meet, holding out both his
hands to him. The savage, not understanding this
civility, and possibly thinking that he was going to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
seize him, threw his spear, and wounded the governor
rather badly, but not mortally. Several other spears were
thrown, and one musket fired, but no injury was done
on either side. A few days after the accident Bennillong
came with his wife and some companions very near
to the settlement, and an interview between these and
the British officers took place, in which it was agreed
that the governor, as soon as he was able, should visit
the same spot; Bennillong, meanwhile, assuring them
that the man who had inflicted the wound had been
severely beaten. On the tenth day his Excellency was
so far recovered as to go to the place of the whale
feast, together with several officers, all armed. Bennillong
here repeated his assurances to the governor in
person, that the offending party had been well beaten
by him and Cole-be, and added that his throwing the
spear was entirely the effect of his fears, and arose from
an impulse of self-preservation. The day before this
visit nearly 4000 fish had been taken by the colonists,
and between 30 and 40 of these, weighing on an average
about 5 lbs. each, were sent to Bennillong and his party
on the north shore of Port Jackson. After this, tolerably
friendly feelings continued, with some few interruptions,
between the two nations, and Bennillong himself
became very much attached to the governor, insomuch
that he and another native resolved to accompany Captain
Philip to England, when, towards the close of 1792,
that excellent officer resigned his appointment, and
embarked on board of the Atlantic transport-ship. The
two Australians, fully bent upon the voyage, which they
knew would be a very distant one, withstood resolutely,
at the moment of their departure, the united distress of
their wives and the dismal lamentations of their friends.
No more was heard respecting these absentees until
March 1794, when a message was brought from them in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
England, requesting that their wives might be told to
expect them in the course of that year, since, though
well, they had not so completely lost their love of liberty
and of their native country, to prefer London, with its
pleasures and abundance, to the woods of New South
Wales. It was not, however, until August, 1795, that
Bennillong reached his native shores, having become
accustomed to the manners of civilized life, by his long
sojourn among the English people. He declared to his
old acquaintance, with an air and tone that seemed to
expect compliance, that he should no longer suffer them
to fight and cut each other&#8217;s throats, but should introduce
peace among them, and make them love one another.
When they visited him at Government House, he wished
they would contrive to be somewhat more cleanly in
their persons and less coarse in their manners; and he
was quite offended at his sister, who came in such haste
to see him, that she positively forgot to bring anything
else upon her back, except a little nephew! Bennillong
had been an attentive observer of manners, which he was
not unsuccessful in copying; his dress was an object of
no small concern to him, and every one was of opinion
that he had cast off all love for savage life.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival, Bennillong made inquiries after his
wife,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> but having heard no very good account of her
conduct, he at length tempted her by some rose-coloured
clothes and a gipsy bonnet to leave her new lover and
return to her former husband. Bennillong&#8217;s presents,
however pretty, were of very little practical use, and he
was soon afterwards missing, having gone into the Bush
to give his rival a good beating with <em>fists</em> after the English
method. However, all his valour was lost upon his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
wife, who deserted him,&mdash;an event which did not appear
to give him great uneasiness, nor was it much to be
wondered at, since she had been stolen by him. His
absence from the governor&#8217;s house became now frequent,
and when he went out, his clothes were usually left
behind him, although he carefully resumed them on his
return before he made his visit to the governor.</p>

<p>Within a year of his arrival from England this poor
creature had a quarrel with his bosom-friend Cole-be,
whose wife he had coveted, and from whom he received
some severe wounds, together with the cutting inquiry,
&ldquo;Whether he meant that kind of conduct to be a specimen
of English manners?&rdquo; Thus Bennillong by degrees
returned again to all the habits of savage life,&mdash;habits
rendered rather worse than better by the experience he
had gained respecting those of civilized men. He could
not, however, keep on terms with his countrymen, and in
1796 he was obliged to call in the help of the governor&#8217;s
soldiers to protect him from his own people. In the
following year he was accused of having been the
cause of a woman&#8217;s death, who had dreamed, when
dying, that he had killed her; and by some it was said,
that he actually had wounded her, so that it was demanded
of him that he should undergo the ordeal of
having some spears thrown at him. Although he denied
the charge, yet it was not thought unlikely to be true,
for he was now become so fond of drinking that he lost
no opportunity of being intoxicated, and in that state
was savage and violent enough to be capable of any
mischief. On these occasions he amused himself with
annoying and insulting all his acquaintance, who were
afraid to punish him lest they should offend his white
friends. But, however, his interest with the latter was
fast declining, for in an affray between the natives,
Bennillong chose to throw a spear among the soldiers, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
interfered to prevent further mischief; and one of these
was dreadfully wounded by him. He was, notwithstanding,
set at liberty, but being offended at the blame
his behaviour had brought down upon him he would
sometimes walk about armed, and declare that he did
so for the purpose of spearing the governor whenever he
might see him! After repeated affrays and quarrels
with his wife&#8217;s lover and other natives, Bennillong, who
had almost entirely quitted the comforts and quiet of
civilized life, was dangerously wounded twice within two
or three months. And although no more is related concerning
him, and it is true that he had recently recovered
of several very severe wounds, yet the probability is,
that this weak and violent savage was not long afterwards
cut off in the midst of life by an untimely and
cruel death.</p>

<p><em>Barangaroo&#8217;s Funeral.</em>&mdash;When Barangaroo Daringha,
Bennillong&#8217;s elder wife, who was above fifty at the time
of her death, was to have the funeral rites performed over
her body, it was resolved by her husband that she should
be burned, and the governor, the judge-advocate, and
the surgeon of the colony were invited to the ceremony,
besides whom there were present Bennillong&#8217;s relatives
and a few others, mostly females. The spot for the pile
was prepared by digging out the ground with a stick, to
the depth of a few inches, and in this a heap of wood
was raised to the height of about three feet, the ends
and sides being formed of dry pieces, and the middle of
it consisting of small twigs and branches, broken off for
the purpose, and thrown together. Some grass was then
spread over the pile, and the corpse covered with an old
blanket was placed upon it, with the head towards the
north. A basket with sundry articles belonging to the
deceased was placed by her side, and some large logs
being laid over the body by Bennillong, the pile was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
lighted by one of the party, and was quickly all in a
flame. Bennillong himself pointed out to his friends
that the fire had reached the corpse, and the spot was
left long before the pile was consumed, while the husband
seemed more cheerful than had been expected, and
spoke about finding a nurse among the white women
for his infant and motherless child, Dil-boong.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
next day he invited the same party of Europeans to see
him rake the ashes together, and none of his own people
were present at this ceremony. He went before his
companions in a sort of solemn silence, speaking to no
one until he had paid the last duties to Barangaroo. In
his hand was the spear, with which he meant to punish
the <em>car-rah-dy</em>, or conjurer, for whom he had sent to
attend her in her illness, but who either could not or
would not obey the summons; and with the end of this
spear he collected the funereal ashes into a heap. Over
these he made, with a piece of bark, which served for a
spade, a small mound of earth, on each side of which
was placed a log of wood, and on the top the bark with
which he had constructed it. All was done with the
utmost care and neatness, and he seemed pleased, when,
in reply to his inquiries, he was told by his friends that
it was &ldquo;good.&rdquo; His behaviour throughout was solemn
and manly, and he was perfectly silent during the whole
of the ceremony, from which nothing was suffered to
withdraw his attention. Nor did he seem desirous to
get quickly through it, but paid these last rites of affection
with a care that did honour to his feelings towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
one, for whom, notwithstanding his barbarism, he
appeared to feel a sincere and strong attachment.
When his melancholy task was ended, he stood for a
few moments, with his hands folded over his bosom, and
his eye fixed upon his labours, in the attitude of a man
in profound thought. What were his thoughts then it is
impossible certainly to declare, but they may have been
more nearly akin to those of the mere civilized worldling
than we might at first imagine. Death brings all
men to an equality, and throws down every distinction
but one. That distinction, indeed, so far from
overthrowing, death renders more marked and conspicuous
than before, clearly making manifest the difference
between the believer and the unbeliever, &ldquo;between him
that serveth God, and him that serveth him not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Spitting Tribe.</em>&mdash;This was the name given by
Major Mitchell to one of the most troublesome and
ferocious of the native tribes, the place of whose
habitation is on the lonely banks of the Darling, in the
interior of Eastern Australia. When these disagreeable
people were first met with, the man who was taking
care of the sheep belonging to the exploring party held
out a green bough; but the savage, who had before
pointed a spear at the Englishman, replied to his emblem
of peace by taking a bough, spitting upon it, and
then thrusting it into the fire. Upon Major Mitchell
hastening to the spot, similar expressions of ill will were
manifested, evidently with the purpose of telling the
strangers that they must go back. The native and a
boy who was with him then threw up dust at their
enemies, in a clever way, <em>with their toes</em>. Their feelings
of hostility and defiance were too plainly expressed to
be mistaken. Every effort at conciliation was useless,
until, at length, the enraged native of the Bush retired
slowly along the river bank, singing a war-song as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
went, and showing by his actions that he was going
for his tribe. This happened in the morning; and during
the afternoon of the same day, a party of the tribe made
their appearance, holding out boughs indeed, but with a
very different ceremonial from what had hitherto been
observed.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Their violent and expressive gestures evidently
were intended to drive back the intruders; and
as these last could not but feel that they were not upon
their own ground, they used every endeavour to conciliate
the opposing party. The blacksmith belonging
to the expedition was at work with his bellows and
anvil near the river bank, and his labours seemed to
awaken very much the curiosity of the natives, who,
however, still refused to sit down, and continued to
wave their branches in the faces of the white people,
and to spit at them repeatedly, all which conduct was
patiently endured in the hope of establishing afterwards
a more agreeable and friendly intercourse. As
a peace-offering, a tomahawk was presented to the
leader, who, guessing immediately its use, turned round
to a log, and chopped it. Two other stout fellows then
rudely demanded the British officer&#8217;s pistols from his
belt, whereupon he drew one, and, curious to see the
effect, fired it at a tree. Immediately, as though they had
previously suspected the intruders to be evil demons,
and had at length a clear proof of it, they repeated their
actions of defiance with tenfold fury, accompanying these
with demoniac looks, hideous shouts, and a war-song,&mdash;crouching,
jumping, spitting, springing with the spear,
and throwing dust at them, as they slowly retired. In
short, their hideous crouching postures, measured gestures,
and low jumps, to the tune of a wild song, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the fiendish glare of their countenances, at times all
black, but now all eyes and teeth, seemed a fitter spectacle
for Pandemonium than for the light of the bounteous
sun. Thus they retired, dancing in a circle, and
leaving the strangers in expectation of their return, and
perhaps an attack in the morning. Whatever was the
cause of their hostility, any further attempt to quiet
them appeared out of the question, and it was too likely
that ere long the English party would be forced to prove
their superiority by arms.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>These troublesome visitors did not, however, make
their appearance again before the following afternoon,
when their curiosity and desire to get more presents
brought them forth from their hiding-places in the woods.
By degrees, they seemed to gain a little more confidence;
but signs of defiance were still made; and as their fears
diminished, their love of pilfering appeared to increase.
The blacksmith was at work this day also; and they
moved towards him, commencing at the same time a kind
of chant, and slowly waving their green boughs. There
was evidently some superstition in the ceremony, and
one of the parties concerned in it was a <em>coradje</em>, or priest,
who occasionally turned his back upon the Europeans,
and touched his eye-brows, nose, and breast; then pointing
his arm to the sky, and with his hand afterwards
laid upon his breast, pouring forth a most solemn chant.
The blacksmith, with whose honest occupation all this
formed a strange contrast, had been ordered not to laugh
nor stop working, which orders he obeyed as long as it was
practicable. But, gradually, the black visitors gathered
round the forge, and began to pilfer whatever they could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
lay hand or foot upon, until the persecuted smith could
no longer proceed with his work. The best part of this
scene was, that they did not mind being observed by any
one, except the blacksmith, supposing that they were
robbing him only. His patience, however, being severely
tried, he was at last tempted to give one of them a push,
when a scene of chanting, spitting, and throwing dust
commenced on the part of the thief, who was a stout
fellow and carried a spear, which he seemed inclined to
use. One or two articles were lost in spite of all efforts,
but the explorers were glad to feel at peace with these
people upon any terms, and both parties separated that
night in a tolerably civil way.</p>

<p>On the following day, the travellers began to move
onwards, but they did not leave behind (as they had
hoped) their troublesome neighbours. The natives
rushed forth from the woods in greater numbers than
ever, <em>being painted white</em>, and many of them carrying
spears, and shouting. A horse belonging to one of the
party was so startled at this, that he galloped away, and
was with some little difficulty recovered. The threats
and defiance of the savages were again repeated; and
when the party of explorers began to proceed onwards,
the whole of the woods appeared to be in flames. Various
annoyances and hindrances were experienced from these
disagreeable inhabitants of the Bush, during the next
ten or twelve days; after which an event happened,
which, though sad and unfortunate in itself, was yet
calculated to fill the minds of these impudent savages
with some respect and awe for the power of the Europeans.
Joseph Jones,&mdash;the man who attended the flock
of sheep, which accompanied Major Mitchell&#8217;s party in
their wanderings in the interior of New Holland,&mdash;had
been sent for some water; and the tea-kettle he carried
with him was the sole cause of the quarrel that ensued.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
As he was getting up the river bank with the water,
another man being stationed (as usual) at the top to
protect him with his pistol, one of the natives, with
others in his company, met him half way up, and with
a smile took hold of the pot which he was carrying,
together with the kettle. This was done under pretence
of helping Jones, but, on reaching the top of the bank,
the savage, in the same jocose way, held it fast, until a
woman said something to him; and then, letting the
pot go, he seized the kettle with his left hand, and at
the same time struck Jones senseless to the ground by
a violent blow on the forehead, inflicted with a club
which he held in his right. On seeing this the other
man, who was stationed by way of protection, fired,
and wounded the savage, who swam across the river,
and made off as well as he could; but the rest of the
tribe were now advancing. The Englishman fired twice
at them, and the second time, unfortunately, he shot
the woman already mentioned, who, with her child
fastened to her back, slid down the bank, and lay,
apparently dying, in the water. At this moment three
other Englishmen arrived, who had been sent off from
the camp when the noise of fire-arms was heard, and
one man among the natives was shot in the breast, but
little more mischief was done, for the tribe speedily
dispersed, having dragged away the dead body of the
woman; while Joseph Jones returned, wounded and
bleeding, to the camp of the explorers. When night
arrived, &ldquo;a death-like silence,&rdquo; says Major Mitchell,
&ldquo;prevailed along the banks of the river; no far-heard
voices of natives at their fires broke, as before, the
stillness of the night, while a painful sympathy for
the child bereft of its parent, and anticipations of the
probable consequences to us, cast a melancholy gloom
over the scene. The waning moon at length arose, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
I was anxiously occupied with the observations, which
were most important at this point of my journey, when
a mournful song, strongly expressive of the wailing of
women, came from beyond the Darling, on the fitful
breeze which still blew from the north-west.&rdquo; The feelings
of a brave but humane British officer, surrounded by
difficulties, with very few except convicts under his command,
annoyed by natives, yet anxious not to injure them,
and just about to turn back from the journey of discovery
which he had hitherto successfully pursued; the
feelings of Major Mitchell under the circumstances so
touchingly described by him can scarcely be imagined.
The thoughts of a veteran who had served his country
during many long years of war and strife, must have
wandered back to past scenes and by-gone days, while
he stood in that solitary wilderness; and when the wild
shrill cry of savage grief came floating upon his ears,
he must have felt most deeply those strange sensations
which we experience</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
 <span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;When, musing o&#8217;er companions gone,</span><br />
  We doubly feel ourselves alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These savages of the Darling have the power of doing
with their toes many things most surprising to men
who wear shoes, and have never been accustomed from
infancy to climb trees after the Australian fashion.
With their toes they gather the fresh-water muscles from
the muddy bottoms of rivers or lakes, and these are one
of their principal articles of food in the neighbourhood
of the Darling. In the attempts of the Spitting Tribe to
steal from the English party, their feet were much
employed, and they would tread softly on any article,
seize it with the toes, pass it up the back, or between
the arm and side, and so conceal it in the arm-pit, or
between the beard and throat. The hoary old priest
of the Spitting Tribe, while intent upon tricks of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
kind, chanted an extraordinary hymn to some deity or
devil; the act was evidently superstitious and connected
with no good principle. Arrangements were probably
being made, and some of these strange ceremonies
observed by them, for the purpose of destroying the
strangers, <em>intruders</em> they might be called. &ldquo;And no
man,&rdquo; observes Major Mitchell, &ldquo;can witness the
quickness and intelligence of the aborigines, as displayed
in their instant comprehension of our numerous appliances,
without feelings of sympathy. They cannot be
so obtuse, as not to anticipate in the advance of such a
powerful race as ours, the extirpation of their own, in
a country which barely affords to them the means of
subsistence.&rdquo; Yet, melancholy though the reflection
may appear, it is but too true, that scarcely any hope
of improving and civilizing these barbarous people can
be at present reasonably indulged. What a picture does
the same humane traveller already quoted draw of the
tribes about the lower part of the Darling, of whose
character the Spitting Tribe may serve for a specimen.
&ldquo;It seldom happened,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that I was particularly
engaged with a map, a drawing, or a calculation, but
I was interrupted by them or respecting them. Our
gifts seemed only to awaken on their part a desire to
destroy us, and to take all we had. While sitting in the
dust with them, according to their custom, often have
they examined my cap, evidently with no other view
than to ascertain whether it would resist the blow of a
<em>waddy</em>, or short stick. Then they would feel the
thickness of my dress, and whisper together, their eyes
occasionally glancing at their spears and clubs. The
expression of their countenances was sometimes so
hideous, that, after such interviews, I have found
comfort in contemplating the honest faces of the horses
and sheep; and even in the scowl of &lsquo;the patient ox,&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
I have imagined an expression of dignity, when he may
have pricked up his ears, and turned his horns towards
these wild specimens of the &lsquo;lords of the creation.&rsquo;
Travellers in Australian deserts will find that such
savages cannot remain at rest when near, but are ever
anxious to strip them by all means in their power
of every thing. It was not until we proceeded as
conquerors, that we knew any thing like tranquillity on
the Darling; and I am now of opinion, that to discourage
at once the approach of such natives, would
tend more to the safety of an exploring party than
presenting them with gifts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Mulligo&#8217;s Death.</em>&mdash;The following curious account of
the death of a certain native of Western Australia is
given by Captain Grey. Mulligo, for such was the
name of the unfortunate man, had severely hurt his
spine by a fall from a tree, and having lost the use of
his lower limbs, he gradually wasted away, until, in
about two months&#8217; time, he became a perfect skeleton,
and was evidently dying. Soon after day-break, Captain
Grey came to the hut of Mulligo, and found him alive
indeed, but breathing so slightly that it was scarcely to
be perceived. His head rested on his aged mother&#8217;s
knees, who leaned over him in tears, while other women
were seated around, their heads all verging to a common
centre, over the wasted frame of the dying man; they
were crying bitterly, and scratching their cheeks,
foreheads, and noses, with their nails, until the blood
trickled slowly from the wounds. The men, meanwhile,
were preparing their spears for the fight, which was
expected to take place respecting the two wives of
Mulligo, the title of his heir being disputed. Other
native females soon began to arrive in small parties,
each one carrying her long stick in her hand, and each
party marching slowly after the eldest woman belonging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to it. When they came within about thirty or forty
yards of the hut of the dying man, they raised the most
piteous cries, and hurrying their pace, moved rapidly to
the place where the other women were seated, recalling
to the mind of one acquainted with the Bible, that
custom alluded to by Jeremiah (chap. ix. 17, 18). As
they came up to the bark hut, many of them struck it
violently with their sticks, producing by the blow a dull
hollow sound, and then, after joining the assembled
circle, chanting mournfully the usual songs on these
occasions. Then, suddenly, one of the women in a
frenzy would start up, and standing in front of the hut,
while she waved her stick violently in the air, would
chant forth curses against the sorcerers, who, as she
believed, had been the cause of Mulligo&#8217;s sufferings.
It was strange to watch the effect of these wild chants
upon the savage countenances of the men; one while they
sat in mournful silence; again they grasped firmly and
quivered their spears; and by and by a general &ldquo;Ee-Ee,&rdquo;
pronounced in their throat, with the lips closed, burst
forth in token of approbation at some affecting part of
the speech.</p>

<p>Time wore on; each withered beldame by turns
addressed the party, while the poor creature, whose
dying moments were thus disturbed, was gradually
sinking. At last he ceased to live, and at that moment
an old woman started up, and with grief and rage,
poured forth her curses upon the <em>Boyl-yas</em>, and tore
the hut in which Mulligo had been lying to pieces,
saying, &ldquo;This is now no good.&rdquo; Her proceedings
excited the feelings of the men, and at last Moon-dee,
the most violent of them, was on the point of spearing
one of the wives of the deceased, but he was withheld by
some of the women. The cause of Moon-dee&#8217;s anger
was afterwards thus explained. About two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
months before this time, a cloak belonging to Mulligo&#8217;s
brother had been stolen, and, it was supposed, given to
one of the sorcerers, who gained thereby some mysterious
power over either of the two brothers, which he
had exercised on Mulligo, when he caused him to fall
and injure his back. Another sorcerer was called in,
who applied fire to the injured part, but without any
success; and since the poor fellow was daily wasting
away, it was imagined that the unfriendly sorcerers
came every night to feast upon the invalid during his
hours of sleep. But Moon-dee chose to fancy that if
his wife had been more watchful, the <em>Boyl-yas</em> might
have been detected, and therefore he intended to spear
her in the leg, in order to punish her supposed neglect.
This outrage was, however, prevented; and the two
trembling partners of the deceased, neither of whom was
above fifteen years old, fled into Perth, to find among
Europeans a refuge from the violence of their own
countrymen. After vowing vengeance against a great
many of the sorcerers, though they had no proof whatever
against any of these in particular, the men followed
the widows to Perth, to see that no one stole them away;
and a few only were left with the women to superintend
the funeral.</p>

<p>In about an hour&#8217;s time, the body was removed to a
distance of nearly half a mile from the spot where the
death had taken place, and the women were still leaning
over it, uttering the words, <em>yang, yang, yang</em>, and
occasionally chanting a few sentences. The grave was
then dug, as usual, due east and west, with no better
instruments than sticks and hands; but afterwards,
when many Europeans had assembled at the spot, to the
great annoyance of the natives, these last occasionally
employed a spade, although, from the extreme narrowness
of the grave, it was no easy matter to make use of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
this implement. During the digging an insect had been
thrown up, whose motions were watched with the
deepest interest, and since the animal crawled off in the
direction of Guildford, this was thought an additional
proof of the guilt of the sorcerers of that place, who had
before been suspected, because the cloak had been
stolen by a man living near this settlement.</p>

<p>When the grave was completed, they set fire to some
dried leaves and twigs which they threw in, and old
Weeban, the friendly sorcerer, knelt at the foot of the
grave, with his back to the east, and his head bowed
down to the earth in a posture of the deepest attention;
his office being a very important one, namely, to discover
in what direction the hostile <em>Boyl-yas</em> would take their
flight, when drawn out of the earth by the heat. The
fire roared for some time in the grave; and the hollow
sound of the flames arising from the narrow opening
evidently aroused the superstitious fears of the bystanders,
until the old conjuror signified by his actions
that the authors of the mischief were gone off in the
direction of Guildford. The relatives of the deceased
appeared satisfied at knowing upon whom to avenge
the foul witchcraft, and at being assured of the cause of
their friend&#8217;s death. The body of Mulligo was then
taken from the females, his mother having, for the last
time, fervently kissed its cold lips; and the corpse was
lowered into the grave, and placed upon a bed of leaves,
which had been laid there directly the fire was
extinguished; the face being, according to custom, turned
towards the east. The women continued their mournful
songs, and the grave was filled up with small green
boughs and earth, until the tomb was completed,
presenting the appearance, owing to the heaps placed at
the head and foot, of three graves nearly alike in size
and form, lying in a due east and west direction. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the same evening, the old mother was found sitting at
the place where her son&#8217;s remains were interred, and
crying bitterly. She had caught the <em>Boyl-yas</em>, she said,
in the very act of sitting round Mulligo&#8217;s grave, for the
purpose of preying upon his miserable body, and she
pointed out their tracks at the spot from which they
sprung into the air, in the direction of Guildford, but
European eyes were not keen enough to detect these
mysterious traces of mischief.</p>

<p><em>The Corrobory.</em>&mdash;The natives have a dance, called
corrobory, of a very original character, and almost
universally prevalent on the shores of Australia. The
dance always takes place at night; and not only in this
respect, but likewise in the preparation and excitement
occasioned by it, a resemblance may be traced between
the <em>corrobory</em> and the dances of more civilized nations.
The curious evolutions and figures performed in these
assemblies of savages, are regulated by time beaten upon
stretched skins or drums,&mdash;the only musical instrument
that is commonly seen among them; and while the light
of blazing boughs is thrown upon the scene of festivity,
the rude music is accompanied by a song. Darkness
seems essential to the effect of the whole; and the
painted figures coming forward from the obscurity of
the background, while the singers and beaters of time
are invisible, have a highly theatrical effect. Each dance
appears most tastefully progressive; the movement being
first slow, and introduced by two persons, displaying
graceful motions, both of arms and legs; others, one by
one, join in, each gradually warming into the truly
savage attitude of the &ldquo;<em>corrobory</em>&rdquo; jump; the legs then
stride to the utmost, the head is turned over one
shoulder, the eyes glare, and are fixed with savage
energy all in one direction; the arms also are raised,
and inclined towards the head, the hands usually grasping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
some warlike weapons. The jump now keeps time
with each beat; the dancers at every movement taking
six inches to one side, all being in a connected line, led
by the first, which line, however, is sometimes <em>doubled</em>
or <em>tripled</em>, according to numbers; and thus great effect
is added; for when the front line jumps to the left, the
second jumps to the right; the third to the left again,
and so on, until the action gains due intensity, when all
suddenly stop at the same moment. The excitement
which this dance produces in the savage is very
remarkable. However listless the individual may be, lying
perhaps, as usual, half asleep, set him to this, and he
is fired with sudden energy, every nerve is strung to
such a degree, that he is hardly to be known as the
same person, while the <em>corrobory</em> continues.</p>

<p><em>Peerat and his Wives.</em>&mdash;A garden belonging to a soldier
at King George&#8217;s Sound had been robbed by the natives
of nearly a hundred weight of potatoes. This was the
first act of theft that had been committed during the
five months of Governor Grey&#8217;s residence there, although
there had often been as many as two hundred
natives in the settlement, who had no means of subsistence
beyond the natural productions of the country, and
what little they derived from being occasionally employed
by the colonists. And even in this theft of the
potatoes, they had purposely left the large roots, and
had taken away only the smaller ones, in the hope that
by so doing they would lessen the crime. However, the
governor resolved to act promptly and vigorously upon
this first offence, and to avoid the common fault of
Europeans, in confounding the guilty and the innocent
together. By the help of an intelligent native, the tracks
of three persons were found in the garden that had been
robbed, and the footsteps were pronounced to be those
of Peerat&#8217;s two wives, and his son Dal-bean. These had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
all walked off into the Bush, meaning, probably, to avoid
suspicion, and to wait till the affair had passed quietly
over. The governor determined to pursue them, but
this required great secrecy, for Australians are no easy
creatures to catch hold of; and it was not meant to
adopt the popular system of shooting them when they
ran away. Accompanied by four natives only, the governor
pressed forward, following Peerat&#8217;s tracks for
about nine miles in a direction where the Bush had
been set on fire by the natives, until he met with some
of these, who were solemnly informed of the theft and
of the names of the criminals, whom he had come to
take prisoners; if these were given up, it was promised
that they should undergo only the regular punishment
for petty robbery; otherwise, the usual allowance of
flour, which was issued to all the natives every two
months, was to be stopped; and it was threatened that
a party of soldiers should be brought out to fire upon
Peerat and his party wherever they might be found.
These threats, uttered in a very decided tone, gave occasion
to a consultation among the natives, by whom it
was unanimously agreed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Imprimis. That stealing potatoes was a very heinous
offence, more particularly in women.</p>

<p>Secondly. That women were notorious thieves, and
altogether worse characters than men.</p>

<p>Thirdly. That beating women was an every day occurrence.</p>

<p>Fourthly. That losing flour was a great bore; and,</p>

<p>Fifthly. Upon these considerations, Peerat, his wives,
and son, were to be given up.</p>

<p>These resolutions having been passed, the whole
assembly came to the governor to inquire whether he
told the truth, when he said that he was not personally
angry with Peerat&#8217;s family, and that they should not be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
killed; and being satisfied upon this point, they all proceeded
together in search of the offending parties.</p>

<p>Peerat waited quietly to receive them, indeed, he was
not aware of the cause of his being honoured by a visit
from the governor; when, however, he heard of this, he
abused his wives, and promised to thrash them soundly,
but absolutely refused to give either them or his son up
as prisoners. The first man who might lay a finger upon
him was threatened with a spear through the heart, and
the governor was obliged to proclaim the sacredness of
his own person, and to cock both barrels of his gun,
with an assurance that he would shoot poor Peerat in
case of resistance. All savage strife is noisy in the extreme;
even the strife of <em>civilized</em> men in their <em>public
meetings</em> and <em>vestries</em> is often tolerably boisterous,&mdash;and a
great deal of running and leaping about, and quivering
of spears accompanies the former kind of altercation.
While things were in this confusion the governor went
alone to Peerat&#8217;s fire, and seized his little boy, Dal-bean,
but could see nothing of the wives, who were, most
likely, busy digging roots for the family. The boy was
told that if he moved he would be shot, a threat which
kept him very quiet; but Peerat soon found out what
had happened, and came running after them. These
natives are always greatly attached to their children, and
strong proofs of this were now given by the father, who
first declared that the boy had been with him, and that
it was the mother only that had stolen, producing about
a dozen witnesses to prove this to be the truth. However,
the reply to this was by asking the question, How
came the child&#8217;s footmarks in the garden? It was answered
that Peerat&#8217;s second wife had, indeed, been there,
and that she was just the size of the boy; but that plea
would not hold good, since her footsteps had been observed
likewise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
The father now urged the tender years of the lad, and
that he was under the influence of his mother; and then
fairly wept upon his child&#8217;s neck, who was calling upon
his parent and the other natives by name to save him.
The governor&#8217;s own feelings and those of his followers
urged him to let the little fellow go, but he wisely resolved
to act with determination, and held fast by the
prisoner. Spears were now given to Peerat&mdash;a sign of
his quarrel being espoused by those who gave them, and
that he was expected to use them; and, matters having
taken a serious turn, the governor hastened away with
his prisoner and two of his native companions, but not
before he had explained to the others the advantage of
an impartial inquiry and proper punishment of offenders,
in preference to their being exposed to the indiscriminating
fire of Europeans. Peerat was then threatened
with a shot if he did not take himself off, and bring his
wives into the settlement to be punished; and the
matter ended, for the present, in the lodgment of the
youthful Dal-bean safe in the British gaol. In a day or
two afterwards, during which no tidings had been heard
of Peerat and his wives, the little Dal-bean made an
attempt to break out of his place of confinement, by
taking up a loose stone from the floor, with which he
had battered a hole in the door. This, however, he
stoutly denied, asserting that, whilst he was asleep,
sorcerers from the north, having a spite against him, had
entered through some air-holes in the wall and done
this; and, on his persisting in the story, he was told that,
in future, he would be well whipped for neglect, if he did
not give the alarm when these strange visitors came.
Meanwhile, the governor was half inclined to whip him
for telling a story, but he satisfied himself with giving
him a lecture upon the crime of lying, to which the
cunning little rogue replied, by arguing upon the general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
usefulness and prevalence of that vice in the world,
entirely setting aside its evil nature and sinfulness.</p>

<p>The very same day Peerat made his appearance with
a very pitiful tale. He had two wives, and to govern
them both was no easy task, but, although they had been
soundly beaten, they could not be induced to come into
the settlement, until he had threatened to spear them.
This threat had, at last, succeeded, and in recompense for
his sufferings from the loss of his son, and from the
obstinacy and bad temper of his wives, he begged to
be allowed to beat the latter himself. They were ordered
to the spot where the robbery was committed, and there
the native women soon appeared, dreadfully cut and
mangled from the beating they had already received.
One was a nice looking girl, about fourteen, but an incorrigible
thief. Peerat was going to hit her a tremendous
blow upon the head, which must have laid it open.
She stood with her back to her husband, trembling and
crying bitterly. The governor caught Peerat&#8217;s arm,
picked up a little switch from the ground, and told him
to beat her on the shoulders with that, instead of with
his <em>meero</em>. Two slight blows, or rather taps, were given
her, in order to know where it was that the governor
meant her to be struck, but the poor girl cried so bitterly
from fear, that she was pardoned, and so likewise was
the other woman, who had already been severely beaten,
and had at that moment a little child sitting upon her
shoulder, and crying piteously at the sight of its mother&#8217;s
tears. Before the crowd dispersed a lecture was given
them, and they were warned not to presume upon the
governor&#8217;s clemency in the present instance.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the governor, attended by Peerat, his
wives, and a crowd of natives, walked up to the gaol to
release little Dal-bean. The father and the governor
alone entered the prison, and when the gaoler was told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to hand Peerat the whip, the latter took it, and said,
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I will strike him; let not another beat him.&rdquo;
The door of the cell was then opened, and the little boy
was led out: his father ran up to him, caught him in his
arms, and began kissing him; having done this, he told
him he was going to beat him. The little fellow did
not answer a word, but standing as firm and erect as
possible, presented his back to him. The father gave him
one blow, and it was ended&mdash;justice was satisfied. The
criminals had surrendered to salutary laws, of which
they had but a vague and undefined knowledge; it was
their first offence; the nature of the laws they had broken
was explained to them; they were warned to be careful
in their future conduct, and they were set free. Little
Dal-bean, directly they got outside the gaol, walked up
to the governor, took his hand, and squeezed it; then
turning to his mother, he just looked at her; she cried,
but did not dare to kiss him, or to show any other
mark of emotion. The whole party then moved off,
after showering many thanks upon the governor, and
saying, &ldquo;What a good fellow, what a good fellow,&rdquo; or, to
give a literal translation, &ldquo;one good man, one good man!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Woga&#8217;s Captivity.</em>&mdash;In Caledon Bay, upon the northern
coast of New Holland, the natives had behaved very
well to the party under Captain Flinders, which had
landed on their shores, until one of those who had been
most kindly treated ran away with an axe, and from the
thickness of the forest could not be overtaken. It was
indeed here, as in other parts of Australia, no easy
matter to hinder the people from stealing whatever came
within their reach; and in order to check this, two men
were seized by command of Captain Flinders, and after
a little time one of these was set free, upon his
promising by signs to restore the axe, and being made
to understand that the other would be kept as a pledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of this engagement being fulfilled. Much confusion
was noticed among the natives, and preparations were
made for firing upon them in case of necessity, but after
one of the prisoners had been released, they appeared to
have less anxiety, and still no axe was forthcoming.
The prisoner, a youth of about fourteen, whose name
was Woga, was taken in a boat to a place much
frequented by the savages, many of whom were seen
behind the bushes, endeavouring to entice a native
who accompanied the expedition on shore, no doubt
intending to seize him by way of retaliation. The
restoration of the axe was demanded, and the prisoner
seemed to use all his powers to enforce it, but the
constant answer was that the thief, Ye-han-ge-ree,
had been beaten and was gone away; and since
no axe was likely to be brought, Woga was carried on
board the ship, after a great deal of crying, entreating,
threatening, and struggling on his part. He there ate
heartily, laughed, sometimes cried, and noticed every
thing; frequently expressing admiration at what he
saw, and especially at the sheep, hogs, and cats. The
next morning he was taken ashore, and attempted to
make a spring out of the boat, so that it was needful to
bind him, notwithstanding his struggles; but after a
while he became quiet, and enjoyed his meal of rice and
fish, although he was made fast to a tree. A sort of
attack was then made by the other natives upon a party
of gentlemen who had landed to botanize, and who had
been almost surrounded by the savages; but, however,
a couple of shots dispersed their enemies, and two of
the Australians were supposed to have been wounded.
Since the prisoner was thus a cause of mischief to his
fellow-countrymen, and his being carried off would be
an act of injustice, as well as injurious to future visitors
of that coast, at length Captain Flinders, who would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
otherwise willingly have taken Woga with him, resolved
to release him. On that day, the third of his captivity,
Woga appeared to be a little melancholy in his bondage,
but upon the whole had not fared amiss, having been
eating the greater part of the morning and afternoon.
He begged hard to be released; promising, with tears in
his eyes, to bring back the axe; and after having received
some clothing and presents he was suffered to depart. As
far as two hundred yards he walked away leisurely; but
then, looking first behind him, took to his heels with
all his might, leaving his British friends very reasonably
doubtful of the fulfilment of his pathetic promises!</p>

<p><em>Bal-loo-der-ry and the Convicts.</em>&mdash;In 1791, when the
town of Paramatta, about fifteen miles from Sydney, was
first settled, the natives soon began to bring in their fish
and barter it for bread or salted meat; and this proving
a great convenience to the settlers, the traffic was very
much encouraged by them. There were, however, some
among the convicts so unthinking or so depraved, as
wantonly to destroy a canoe belonging to a fine young
man, a native, who had left it at a little distance from
the settlement, as he thought, out of the way of observation,
while he went with some fish he had to sell. His
rage at finding his canoe destroyed was very great: he
threatened to take his revenge, and in his own way,
upon all white people. Three of the offenders, however,
having been seen and described, were taken and
punished, and so were the remainder of them not very
long afterwards. The instant effect of this outrage was,
that the natives discontinued the bringing up of fish;
and Bal-loo-der-ry, whose canoe had been destroyed,
although he had been taught to believe<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
six convicts had been hanged for the offence, meeting a
few days afterwards with an European who had strayed
to some distance from Paramatta, he wounded him in two
places with a spear. This act of Bal-loo-der-ry was followed
by the governor&#8217;s strictly forbidding him to appear
again in any of the settlements; and the other natives,
his friends, being alarmed, Paramatta was seldom visited
by any of them, and all commerce with them was (for the
time) at an end. However, in about two months afterwards,
before the person wounded by him had recovered,
Bal-loo-der-ry ventured into the town with some of his
friends, and one or two armed parties were sent to seize
him. A spear having been thrown, it was said, by him,
two muskets were fired, by which one of his companions
was wounded in the leg, but Bal-loo-der-ry was not
taken. On the following day it was ordered that he was
to be seized whenever an opportunity should offer, and
that any native attempting to throw a spear in his defence,
(since they well knew why he was denounced,)
was, if possible, to be prevented from escaping. Those
who knew this savage regretted that it had been necessary
to treat him thus harshly, for among his countrymen
they had never seen a finer young man. We cannot
finish this melancholy history with a more true reflection
than that of Lieutenant Collins: "How much greater
claim to the appellation of <em>savages</em> had the wretches
(the convicts) who were the cause of this, than the
natives who were termed so!"</p>

<p><em>Native Hospitality and Philosophy.</em>&mdash;After a most
distressing journey in Western Australia, Captain Grey and
his party fell in with a number of natives, at no great
distance from the settlement of Perth. So great had
been the trials of the explorers that a disinclination to
move pervaded the whole party, and their courageous
leader had felt much the same desire to sink into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
sleep of death, that one feels to take a second slumber
in the morning after great fatigue. However they had
aroused themselves, and had managed to walk about
eight miles at the slow rate of a mile and a quarter an
hour, when they came suddenly upon the tracks of the
natives. Kaiber, their guide, announced that they were
wild natives; and, after a second survey, he declared that
they had &ldquo;great bush fury&rdquo; on them, <em>i.e.</em> were subject
to wild untutored rage. It was proposed, however, to
fire a gun as a signal, for since the distance from Perth
was thought to be very trifling, it was hoped that
these natives would understand its meaning. Kaiber
threatened to run away, but the coward was, in fact,
afraid to move five yards from the party, so, sitting down
on his haunches under cover, he kept muttering to himself
various terms of Australian scorn,&mdash;&ldquo;The swan&mdash;the
big-head&mdash;the stone forehead!&rdquo;&mdash;while the Captain advanced
towards the strangers, who no sooner heard the
gun, and saw him approaching, than they came running
to him. Presently, Kaiber accosted one of them by
name, and at the sound of this name, Imbat, the strongest
feeling was awakened; it was well known to the travellers,
and they knew that their lives were safe, and the
end of their journey at hand. Captain Grey was in good
favour with most of the natives of those parts, to whom
he had frequently made presents of <em>flour</em>, and hence
his common appellation among them was &ldquo;Wokeley
brudder,&rdquo; or Oakley&#8217;s brother, that being the name of a
<em>baker</em> residing in Perth.</p>

<p>The women were soon called up, bark-baskets of frogs
opened for the exhausted travellers, <em>by-yu</em> nuts roasted,
and, for a special delicacy, the Captain obtained a small
fresh-water tortoise. He was bidden to sleep while
Imbat cooked, and though the delay which the willing
native&#8217;s skill in cookery occasioned was a little trying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to the patience of hungry men, yet it was not very long
before they were all regaling on the welcome feast. In
reply to the questions of the Englishmen, the natives all
told them that they would see Perth the next morning,
&ldquo;while the sun was still small;&rdquo; and upon finding that
there was a kangaroo hunter with a hut, and a supply of
provisions only seven miles off, Imbat and the Captain
went thither together, to prepare for the comfortable
reception of the rest of the party. However, they found
the hut deserted, its owner having returned to Perth. A
fire was lighted, notwithstanding, and the Englishman
laid down to rest his weary limbs, while the Australian
again began to cook, and in his chattering mood to
philosophize also. &ldquo;What for do you, who have plenty
to eat, and much money, walk so far away in the Bush?&rdquo;
was his first inquiry. The Captain, fatigued and rather
out of humour, made no reply. &ldquo;You are thin,&rdquo; continued
the philosopher, &ldquo;your shanks are long, your
belly is small,&mdash;you had plenty to eat at home, why did
you not stop there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Imbat, you comprehend nothing,&mdash;you
know nothing,&rdquo; was the traveller&#8217;s brief
reply. &ldquo;I know nothing!&rdquo; answered the wise man of
the woods, &ldquo;I know how to keep myself fat; the young
women look at me and say, Imbat is very handsome, he
is fat;&mdash;they will look at you and say, He not good,&mdash;long
legs;&mdash;what do you know? where is your fat? what
for do you know so much, if you can&#8217;t keep fat? I know
how to stay at home, and not walk too far in the Bush:
where is your fat?&rdquo; &ldquo;You know how to talk, long
tongue,&rdquo; answered the Captain;&mdash;&ldquo;And I know how
to make you fat!&rdquo; rejoined Imbat, forgetting his anger,
and bursting into a roar of laughter, as he began stuffing
his guest with frogs, <em>by-yu</em> nuts, &amp;c. The rest of the
party arrived just before nightfall, and, searching the hut,
they found a paper of tea, and an old tin pot, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
they prepared the welcome beverage, after which, having
had a good supper, they all laid down to sleep; and
in the silence of the night, fervent thanks went up from
that lonely hut in the wilderness to the Maker of all
things, whose merciful guidance had again brought them
so near &ldquo;the haven where they would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Widow and her Child.</em>&mdash;During the journey of
Major Mitchell&#8217;s party, exploring the course of the river
Lachlan down to its junction with the Murray, they had
to cross several branches of the former stream, which
gave them some trouble from the steepness of their
banks, until they at length reached the main channel of
the Lachlan, which stream, together with all its tributaries,
was at that time perfectly dry. The welcome
news was then heard that some ponds of water were
near, but at the same time it was reported that natives
were there; so the party approached cautiously, and
having found two pools encamped beside them. The
black people had all fled, except one child, about seven
or eight years old, quite blind, who sat near a fire, and
a poor little girl still younger, who, notwithstanding the
strange appearance of the new visitors, and the terror
exhibited in the flight of her own people, still lingered
about the bushes, and at length took her seat beside
the blind boy. A large supply of the <em>balyan</em> root lay
near them, and a dog so lean that he was scarcely able to
stand, drew his feeble body close up beside the two
children, as though desirous of defending them. Afterwards
an old man came up to the fire, and he directed
the travellers to some of the water-holes in their proposed
route, but could not be prevailed upon to become
their guide. However, he persuaded a widow,
with the little girl just mentioned, who might be about
four years old, to accompany the party and act as guide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
The strangers soon began to learn the value of their
new guide, Tur&agrave;ndurey; for within a fortnight they met
with a number of the natives, approaching in a silent
and submissive manner, each having a green bough
twined round his waist or in his hand; and a parley
was opened with them by means of the widow, as she
was sitting on the opposite bank of a river to that on
which they made their appearance. Some form or ceremony,
it seems, always prevents the male natives, when
strangers to each other, from speaking at first sight; no
such restraint, however, is placed upon their wives or
<em>gins</em>, as they are called. These, with the privilege of
their sex, are ever ready to speak; and the strangers as
readily replied to Tur&agrave;ndurey; so conversation was thus
held across the river. This female guide, who had
before scarcely ventured to look up, now stood boldly
forward to address the strange tribe; and when her
countenance was lighted up, displaying fine teeth, and
great earnestness of manner, it was gratifying to the
travellers to see what spirit their guide possessed.
Being invited to swim over the stream, the children of
the woods complied but on condition that the wild animals
(the sheep and horses) should be driven away,&mdash;a
stipulation at which the widow and other natives in
the British party laughed heartily; nor was their
laughter stopped when they watched the awkward
attempts of these heroes to show off before the females,
while they were unable entirely to conceal their fears
of the silly sheep!</p>

<p>It was no very long time afterwards that an unfortunate
accident happened to the little native child, Ballandella,
who fell from a cart, and one of the wheels passing
over, broke her thigh. On riding up to the spot, Major
Mitchell found the widow, her mother, in great distress,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
lying in the dust, with her head under the limb of her
unfortunate child. The doctor was ordered to set it
immediately; but, from its being broken very near the
socket, it was found difficult to bandage the limb so as
to keep the bone in its place. Every possible care was
taken of the child, and she bore the pain with admirable
patience, though only four years old; while she gave a
curious proof of her good sense at so early an age, by
calling for &ldquo;Majy&rdquo; (the Major), as soon as she had met
with the accident. Little Ballandella did very well, and
was, after about two months&#8217; time, fast recovering from
her misfortune, when the widow, having been travelling
all that time, and being now far distant from her own
country, felt inclined to return; and was prepared to
make nothing of swimming the broad waters of the
Murray, the largest known river in New Holland, pushing
the child before her floating upon a piece of bark,
nor of any other difficulties which might oppose her in
her journey homewards. No objections were offered to
the woman&#8217;s departure, who appeared extremely attached
to her daughter, and half afraid of being deprived of
her. Indeed, it was a tempting opportunity of trying an
experiment of the effect of education upon one of that
race; for the little savage, who at first would prefer a
snake or lizard to a piece of bread, had become so far
civilised at length, as to prefer bread; and it began to
cry bitterly on leaving its European friends. However,
its absence from them was not to be a long one; for, on
the third day, the widow returned again, carrying her
child on her back, after the Australian fashion. She had
seen, she stated, another tribe on the opposite side of
the river, and they had inquired very angrily, who made
the fires upon her side; after which, receiving no reply,
(for she was afraid and had hid herself,) they danced a
<em>corrobory</em> in a furious style, during which she and the
child crept away, and had passed two nights without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
fire and in the rain.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The mother and her daughter
received a kindly welcome, and were as well treated as
before, notwithstanding the petty jealousy of some other
natives, who, it was thought, had persuaded Tur&agrave;ndurey
to go, hoping thus to get a greater share of food for
themselves. After this, the widow and Ballandella
continued with the exploring party during almost the whole
of the remainder of their expedition, making themselves
serviceable in various ways. Sometimes they would
give notice of the approach of the Major, upon his
return from an excursion, long before he had reached
the camp; their quick ears seemed sensible of the sound
of horses&#8217; feet at an astonishing distance, for so only
could it be accounted for that the widow and her infant
daughter, seated at the fire, were always the first
to give notice of the Major&#8217;s approach. Sometimes
Tur&agrave;ndurey would employ herself in a less serious,
though not less useful manner; for on such exploring
expeditions the amusement of the men is a matter of
the first importance. She would exercise her skill in
mimicry or imitation, powers which the natives of New
Holland possess to an amazing degree; and she thus
occasionally amused the men by acting the part of their
leader, taking angles, drawing from nature, and copying
other occupations in which Major Mitchell was frequently
engaged.</p>

<p>On the return of the expedition, it was found needful,
from a scarcity of provisions, to divide into two parties,
one of which was to proceed, under the leader, by forced
marches home to Sydney, while the other was to remain
behind until necessary supplies should be forwarded.
The widow was among the party to be left; but on the

morning of separation she was marked with white round
the eyes,&mdash;the Australian token of mourning,&mdash;and the
face of Ballandella was whitened also. This poor
woman, who had cheerfully carried the child upon her
back, when it was offered that both might be carried in
the carts, and was as careful and affectionate as any
mother could be, had at length determined to entrust to
the Major the care of her daughter. He was pleased
with this proof of confidence, and less unwilling to take
the charge from the knowledge of the wretched state of
slavery to which the native females are doomed. Besides,
the poor child had suffered considerably by the
accident that befel her while with the party of Englishmen,
and she seemed to prefer their mode of living so
much, that her mother at length despaired of being
ever able to instruct her thoroughly in the mysteries of
killing and eating snakes, lizards, rats, and similar
food. The widow had been long enough with Europeans to
learn how much more her sex was respected by civilised
men than by savages; and it was with feelings of this
nature, probably, that she entrusted her child to them,
under the immediate care, however, of a native woman,
the wife of Piper, the guide who had accompanied them
through all the journey. A match was subsequently
made between Tur&agrave;ndurey and king Joey, one of the
native chiefs, by which the good woman gained a handsome
and comfortable settlement for an Australian. The
child Ballandella was a welcome stranger to the Major&#8217;s
own children, among whom she remained, conforming
most willingly to the habits of domestic life, and showing
a very promising aptness of understanding, until she was
transferred, at the removal of the family to England, to
the care of a friend; and the last mention made of Ballandella
is, that she was able to read as well as any white
child of the same age.</p>

<em>Miago.</em>&mdash;This last sketch of native character may
serve to place in a striking, yet fair light, the perplexing
situation of the half-civilised blacks, the strong
inducements for them to relapse into barbarism again, and,
consequently, the difficulty that stands in the way of
their being thoroughly reclaimed. It is impossible to
do this better than in the very words of Captain Grey.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
&ldquo;The officers of the <em>Beagle</em> took away with them a
native of the name of Miago, who remained absent with
them for several months. I saw him on the north-west
coast, on board the <em>Beagle</em>, apparently perfectly
civilised; he waited at the gun-room mess, was temperate,
(never tasting spirits,) attentive, cheerful, and remarkably
clean in his person. The next time I saw him was at Swan
River, where he had been left on the return of the
<em>Beagle</em>. He was then again a savage, almost naked,
painted all over, and had been concerned in several
murders. Several persons here told me,&mdash;&lsquo;You see the
taste for a savage life was strong in him, and he took to
the bush again directly.&rsquo; Let us pause for a moment
and consider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miago, when he was landed, had amongst the white
people none who would be truly friends of his;&mdash;they
would give him scraps from their table, but the very
outcasts of the whites would not have treated him as an
equal,&mdash;they had no sympathy with him,&mdash;he could not
have married a white woman,&mdash;he had no certain means
of subsistence open to him,&mdash;he never could have been
either a husband or a father, if he had lived apart from
his own people;&mdash;where, amongst the whites, was he to
find one who would have filled for him the place of his
black mother, whom he is much attached to? What
white man would have been his brother? What white
woman his sister? He had two courses left open to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
him,&mdash;he could either have renounced all natural ties,
and have led a hopeless, joyless life among the whites,
ever a servant, ever an inferior being; or he could
renounce civilisation, and return to the friends of his
childhood, and to the habits of his youth. He chose
the latter course, and I think that I should have done
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>FIRST YEARS OF THE COLONY OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</strong></p>


<p>One of the greatest efforts to which the industry and
powers of man can be directed is to change a lonely
uncultivated wilderness into an enclosed and fruitful
country,&mdash;to occupy with civilised human beings and
comfortable dwellings those wilds which have hitherto
been nearly deserted, or at best but scantily and occasionally
inhabited by savage barbarians. The colonisation
of New South Wales by the English has been one
of the most successful of these efforts; and certainly
never before did the change effected by industry so
rapidly make itself visible in the face of the new country.
But, although the settlement of this colony may now be
most certainly pronounced to have been a very successful
experiment, it was by no means without hazard, and
disappointment, and suffering, to those who were first
engaged in it. Indeed it would appear to be the lot of
infant colonies to cope with difficulties known only to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
first settlers in uncultivated lands; and while the enterprising
colonist has to endure and struggle against these
early trials, his children or grandchildren, or often the
stranger who has made a favourable bargain of his
property, are the persons who reap the reward of his
toils. It must assuredly be a subject of interest to
every inquiring mind to trace the feeble beginnings of an
infant colony, accompanying it through all its variations
of hope and despondency, of good or ill success, until it
is at length conducted to a state of greatness and
prosperity quite unexampled, when the shortness of its
duration is considered. And since that colony is our
own, since Britain is, for several reasons, unusually concerned,
both morally and politically, in the welfare of
New South Wales, it cannot but be useful as well as
interesting to inquire somewhat concerning the past
history, previously to our entering upon the present
state, of that settlement.</p>

<p>In the year 1770, Captain Cooke, in his first voyage,
had touched upon the eastern coast of New Holland, at
a bay which, from the number of curious flowers that
were there found growing wild, received the name of
Botany Bay. About sixteen years afterwards, when
the American war had closed up the great outlet by
which the mother country had been accustomed to get
rid of the worst of its population, it was resolved to form
a colony for this purpose elsewhere. The coast of
Africa was thought of, but wisely abandoned; and at
length Botany Bay was the spot selected by the English
government, which despatched, in 1787, the <em>Sirius</em> and
the <em>Supply</em>, with six transports and three store-ships,
having on board 565 men and 192 women, convicts,
besides 160 marines, with their officers, some of their
wives, and the necessary crews for working the ships.
Provisions for two years were taken out, tools, agricultural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
implements, and other articles deemed necessary
were also furnished, and the little fleet was placed under
the command of Captain Phillip, the future governor of
the intended colony. Some live stock was obtained at
the Cape of Good Hope, and plants and seeds likely to
be useful were procured likewise at that place, (then
under the Dutch government,) and at Rio Janeiro. In
eight months and a week the voyage was, with the
Divine blessing, completed; and after having sailed 5021
leagues, and touched at both the American and African
continents, they came to an anchor on January 20th,
1788, within a few days&#8217; sail of the antipodes of their
native country, having had, upon the whole, a very
healthy and prosperous voyage. Botany Bay did not
offer much that was promising for a settlement, since it
was mostly surrounded by very poor land, and water
was scarce.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The governor, accordingly, went in person
to examine the two neighbouring harbours of Port
Jackson and Broken Bay, and upon drawing near to the
entrance of the former the coast looked as unpromising
as elsewhere, and the natives on shore continued
shouting, &ldquo;Warra, warra,&rdquo;&mdash;Go away, go away. Captain
Cooke, passing by the heads of Port Jackson,
thought there might be found shelter within for a boat
but Captain Phillip was agreeably surprised at finding
there one of the finest harbours in the world; and since
the goodness of the soil and the supply of water appeared
to be sufficient, it was resolved to fix the new
settlement in one of the coves of this large and beautiful
inlet. The spot chosen was near a run of fresh water,
which stole silently through a very thick wood, the
stillness of which was then for the first time interrupted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
by the rude sound of the labourer&#8217;s axe; and fifty years
afterwards so great a change had taken place here, that
the lowest price of crown land was then 1,000<em>l.</em> an acre,
and in eligible situations sometimes a great deal more.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The royal commission appointing the governor was
read, together with the letters patent establishing courts
of justice; and the behaviour of the convicts soon rendered
it needful to act upon these, for, within a month
of their landing, three of them were tried, found guilty,
and severely punished. The ground was begun to be
gradually cleared, a sort of farm was prepared to receive
the live stock, and a garden for the plants and seeds;
and, in obedience to the orders of the government at
home, the <em>Supply</em>, commanded by Lieutenant King, was
sent to Norfolk Island, some few days&#8217; sail to the northeast
of Port Jackson, for the purpose of forming a colony
there in which the flax of New Zealand might be cultivated.
With respect to the first progress of the colony
at Sydney, it was very slow, in consequence both of the
idleness and ignorance of the great majority of the
colonists, to say nothing of their wickedness. In spite
of all the efforts of the governor to prevent it,
misunderstanding soon began to arise between the convicts
and the natives, and it seemed impossible in an infant
colony to put a sufficient check upon some of the unruly
spirits belonging to the former class, while, at the
same time, the thievish temper of the natives began very
early to show itself, and to provoke injuries from men
possessed of fire-arms. It must be owned, however,
that proper regard was not always paid to the rights of
the poor savages; and even so late as in the year 1810,
a person charged with shooting at a native and wounding
him, was tried simply for an assault; whilst another,
who had committed a similar offence against a European
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
was tried on the same day for his life!<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In the beginning
of May, not four months after the arrival of the
British ships at Port Jackson, and at a time when death
and disease were making sad havoc among the settlers,
it was found needful to cut short the life of one very
juvenile offender by the hand of justice. James Bennett,
a youth of only seventeen years of age, was executed
for burglary, and died confessing that the love of idleness
and bad connexions had been his ruin. Soon after
this, three convicts were killed, and a fourth dangerously
wounded, by the natives; and upon inquiry it was found
that two of them had robbed these people of a canoe, an
act of injustice which was, no doubt, the cause of their
death. The celebration of King George III.&#8217;s birthday,
on June the 4th, gave an opportunity to the
evil-disposed to commit several robberies, and two of
these afterwards suffered death for their offences, while
another, who had gone into the woods, was proclaimed
an outlaw. For want of any overseers or police, except
those taken from their own class, the convicts were
getting beyond all discipline; and so utterly reckless
and improvident were some of them, that they would
consume their weekly allowance of provisions by the
end of the third or fourth day, and trust for their supply
during the rest of the week to the chance of being able
to steal from others that were more provident.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> One of
these degraded creatures is stated to have made up his
week&#8217;s allowance of flour (eight pounds) into cakes,
which having devoured at one meal, he was soon after
taken up, speechless and senseless, and died the following
day. Among a population like that of which we are
treating, while crimes were lamentably common, conviction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
was comparatively rare. There was so much
tenderness to each other&#8217;s guilt, such an acquaintance
with vice and the different degrees of it, that, unless
detected in the fact, it was next to impossible to bring
an offence home to the transgressors. And with respect
to their intercourse with the natives, though the convicts
who suffered from them generally contrived to make out
themselves to be in the right; yet, even upon their own
showing, every accident that happened was occasioned
by a breach of positive orders repeatedly given. In New
South Wales, no less than in every other country,
obedience to lawful authority was proved to be the
safest and best way, after all; nor could that way be
forsaken with impunity.</p>

<p>Amid the mass of moral corruption, which the British
ships had thus imported into the coasts of New Holland,
the only hope of infusing health and purity was from
religion. But, unhappily, the age in which that expedition
left the English shores, was certainly not a
religious age; if there was less <em>hypocrisy</em> then than
there now is, certainly there was less <em>real piety</em>. In
the great towns of the mother country, population and
wealth were allowed to make rapid strides, without a
single thought being entertained of applying a portion of
the increasing wealth of the nation to the spiritual instruction
of its increasing population. If there was no
room for the poorer classes of society at the parish church,
it was thought they might go to the meeting-house; and
if there was no room for them there, they might stay at
home on the Lord&#8217;s day and be idle; it was doing no
worse than many of their betters, in a worldly sense,
were constantly in the habit of doing.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> While notions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and practices of this nature prevailed at home, it was
not to be expected that any very extraordinary attention
would be paid to the religious instruction of the convicts
and other settlers in New South Wales. Yet since,
even then, it would have been thought shocking to have
left a large gaol, with 757 prisoners in it, altogether
destitute of the offices of religion, so it could not have
been expected that the same number of convicts would
ever have been cast forth as evil from their native
land, and their souls left to perish on the other side of
the globe, without a single chance, humanly speaking,
of receiving those blessings of forgiveness and grace,
which Christ died to procure for all men. But, whatever
might have been thought before hand, or whatever
may have been the immediate cause of such neglect, it
positively appears, that, &ldquo;when the fleet was on the
point of sailing, in the year 1787, no clergyman had
been thought of,&rdquo; nor was it without a strong appeal to
those in authority from one whose conduct in this
instance is worthy of all praise, <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span>, aided by
the interest of Bishop Porteus with Sir Joseph Banks,
that the Rev. William Johnson was appointed chaplain.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
From whatever cause this oversight may have arisen,
whether it was intentional, or (what is more likely)
merely the consequence of forgetfulness and carelessness,
it speaks pretty plainly for the religious indifference
of the government. However, the colony was,
happily, not permitted to be founded without any one
present to administer the sacraments and ordinances,
and enforce the duties of our holy religion among the
first settlers and convicts.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> By Divine Providence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
acting through the instrumentality of man, the British
nation was spared the sin and shame, which it had well
nigh incurred, of casting forth from its own shores a
vile mass of uncleanness and corruption, and forgetting
at the same time to place amongst it the smallest
portion of that good leaven by which alone its evil
might be corrected. Accordingly, one chaplain<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> was
sent out to officiate among about 1000 souls, who were
at first dispersed in eleven ships, and more than two-thirds
of them were in a state of extreme spiritual need,
inasmuch as they had been guilty of gross and flagrant
offences. And thus, thanks to the zeal and good feeling
which had gained a victory over the supineness of government,
the discharge of religious duties on the Sunday was
never omitted at Sydney, Divine service being performed
in the open air whenever the state of the weather would
permit. All seems to have been done by the chaplain
which could be effected under circumstances of great
discouragement.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> When our blessed Redeemer sent forth
his disciples, he sent them by two and two, and how encouraging,
in the midst of an evil world, is the conversation
or counsel of a christian friend that is dearer
than a brother! But the chaplain of New South Wales
had no such assistance to fall back upon; he was left
alone and single-handed&mdash;yet not alone, for Christ is ever
with his authorised ministers, to fight against the
mighty power of evils by which he was surrounded.
He visited the sick and the convicts, going from settlement
to settlement, and from hut to hut; travelling to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the more distant stations, that were afterwards formed,
as far as he could reach, and assembling as many as he
could for divine service. With what success these
efforts were attended we shall be better able to judge
hereafter; but one truth must be borne in mind, which
is, that, in the very nature of things, evil will make
itself more prominent and noticed in the world than
good; so that, whilst it may almost appear from the
history of the colony, as though there was not one godly
man left in it, we shall do well to remember that there
may have been, nevertheless, many a one who was profited
by the ministry of Christ&#8217;s Church among them, many
a Naaman who had been taught to forsake the evil
thing which he once delighted in worshipping, many a
knee which had not bowed to Baal, and many a mouth
which had not kissed his image.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>However, it cannot be denied that the greater number
of the settlers of every description were but little disposed
to listen to the words of eternal truth, although they were
ready enough to listen to any falsehood which promised
well for their worldly interests. Thus, before the first
year of the colony had expired, it was pretended and
believed that a <em>gold mine</em> had been discovered. The
specimens of this which the impostor produced, were
manufactured out of a guinea and a brass buckle; and
his object in deceiving was, that he might get clothes
and other articles in exchange for his promised gold
dust, from the people belonging to the store ships. But
his cheat was soon discovered, and all that his gold dust
finally procured him, was a severe flogging, and before
the end of the year he was executed for another offence.
Yet it would not be far from the truth to state, that the
British had indeed discovered a gold mine in Sydney,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
by working which with industry, ability, and perseverance,
enormous riches have been obtained. When the
story of the mine was invented, the land around Port
Jackson was unproductive, and the hills wild or barren,
but in little more than fifty years from that time the
imports into the Port of Sydney amounted in 1840 to
&pound;2,462,858, while the amount of goods exported from the
same place during that year was valued at &pound;1,951,544.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Where was there ever a gold mine that was known to
make a return so profitable as this to those that
worked it?</p>

<p>The great object, and generally the most difficult to
be obtained, in forming altogether a new colony, is to
make it begin to produce a sufficiency to supply its own
necessary wants. But, although this object was kept
steadily in view from the very first in New South Wales,
yet were there many hindrances to be overcome, and
much suffering to be endured, before it was finally
gained. The land near the new settlement is none of
the best for farming operations, and persons at all
acquainted with agriculture appear to have been very
scarce among the settlers and convicts; besides which,
the prevailing idleness was so great, that it seemed
almost impossible to make the men exert themselves;
and, perhaps, nothing less than the want and privations,
which they subsequently endured, could have had this
effect. A regular supply of provisions had constantly
been issued from the government stores, and the convicts,
with that short-sighted imprudence by which the vicious
are generally distinguished, had never given themselves
the trouble of looking forwards to the necessity of raising
a supply of food for themselves. Meanwhile, although
farming operations were going on but slowly, and not
very successfully, the stores were being lessened at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
rapid rate, not only by the ordinary issue of provisions,
but likewise by rats and pilferers. Six soldiers, and an
accomplice who turned king&#8217;s evidence, were discovered,
after eight months of impunity, by means of a key which
was left by one of them in the lock, upon his being disturbed
by the patrol; and these men, having betrayed
their trust as sentinels, and carried on a regular system
of plunder for the purpose of indulging themselves in
vice and drunkenness, were all executed. In April 1789
the <em>Sirius</em> returned, bringing the first cargo of provisions
received by the colony, which was, however, only
equal to four months&#8217; supply at full rations. But full
rations were not to continue much longer in the infant
settlement. In November, 1789, very nearly two years
after the arrival of the colonists, it was found needful to
reduce the allowance to two-thirds of every sort of
provisions, spirits alone excepted. No alteration was
made in the allowance of the women, who were already
upon two-thirds of the full ratio of a man; and it was
eagerly and confidently expected that, after having
waited so long, it would be but a short period more
before an ample supply of all that was necessary would
be received from the mother country.</p>

<p>In November, which is one of the summer months of
the Australian calendar, the little harvest of the colony
was got in. At Rose Hill, (or Paramatta, as it is now
called,) where the best land had been found, upwards of
two hundred bushels of wheat, about thirty-five bushels
of barley, besides a small quantity of oats and Indian
corn, were harvested; and the whole of this produce was
intended to be kept for seed. At Sydney, the spot of
cleared ground called the Governor&#8217;s Farm had produced
about twenty-five bushels of barley. But the evil spirit
of thieving was still as rife as ever among the convicts,
and the young crops of wheat were the objects of plunder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
(especially after the reduction of the allowance,)
notwithstanding the immense importance of preserving
seed sufficient to crop a larger breadth of land for the
following year. In the very beginning of 1790 the provisions
brought from England wholly failed, having just
about lasted during the two years for which they had
been calculated; and the colonists then became totally
dependent upon the slender stock brought for them by
the <em>Sirius</em> from the Cape of Good Hope. Great anxiety
began to be felt for an arrival from England, and a flagstaff<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
was erected on the south head of the entrance to
the harbour of Port Jackson, so that a signal might be
there made upon the first appearance of the expected
vessel. In hope of this welcome event the eyes of the
colonists were often directed thither, and often must
their hearts have grown sick from the tedious delay of
the hope in which they indulged. Certainly, it is a
remarkable instance of the hard-heartedness and corruption
of man&#8217;s nature, that, even under these circumstances,
with the horrors of famine daily in view, left
alone on a remote and desolate coast, and, as it appeared,
forsaken by the rest of the world, they did not profit
by the lessons thus forcibly brought before them, nor
listen with any good effect to the warnings taught them
by sorrow and trouble, those great and awakening
preachers of righteousness.</p>

<p>During the anxious interval that succeeded, everything
that was possible to be done for the public advantage
was done by the governor. Occasionally, a fair
supply of fish had been brought in, and accordingly a
boat was employed to fish three times in the week, and
the whole quantity that was taken was issued out in
addition to the rations, which were equally distributed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to every person, no distinction being made in favour of
the governor himself, who, when he had a party at
Government House, always requested his guests to bring
their bread with them, for there was none to spare;&mdash;in
February, 1790, there were not four months&#8217; provisions
in the colony, even at half allowance. These circumstances
required thoughtful and vigorous measures to
be promptly taken, and since Norfolk Island was a more
fertile spot, and much better supplied with provisions at
that time, it was resolved to send some of the convicts
thither, unless the expected supplies from England
should arrive before March 3d, the day fixed for their
departure. 116 male and 68 female convicts, with 27
children, were thus sent away, and the colony wore quite
a deserted appearance. Every effort was made to
prevent the destruction of live stock, which was very
rapidly taking place, and towards the end of March a
yet further reduction was necessary in the allowances,
which were then to be given out daily; an alteration at
the same time was made in the hours of public labour,
and the afternoons of each day were given up to the
people to work for themselves in their own gardens.
The fish that was caught was also issued out as part of
the allowance, but at a more liberal rate,&mdash;ten pounds of
fish being deemed equal to two and a half pounds of pork.
In the midst of this necessity it is gratifying to find that
the witness of the Church, though, as usual, too little
heeded, was yet not silent; &ldquo;attention to religious
duties,&rdquo; <em>i.e.</em> to Divine worship on Sundays, &ldquo;was never
omitted, and service was performed on Good Friday.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
But the early settlers of New South Wales were taught
by sad experience the truth of that common saying that
bids us to &ldquo;welcome the sorrow that comes alone.&rdquo; It
had been arranged that the <em>Sirius</em> should return
immediately from Norfolk Island, and then should sail direct
for China to procure a supply of provisions immediately.
But Providence never permitted the <em>Sirius</em> again to float
upon the quiet waters of Sydney Cove. The vessel was
lost upon a reef at Norfolk Island, after having landed
most of those on board, and the others escaped with
their lives, but the ship was totally destroyed. Disgraceful
to relate, it was set on fire by two convicts who
had been allowed to go on board on the second day after
the wreck, in the hope of saving the live hogs, but these
men got drunk with the liquor they found, and set the
ship on fire in two places, nor was it without great
difficulty that they were themselves rescued. This sorrowful
intelligence was brought by the <em>Supply</em>,&mdash;the only
remaining hope of procuring relief for the wants of the
colony. After various precautionary measures had been
taken, the <em>Supply</em> was despatched to Batavia, under orders
to procure, not only a quantity of provisions, but also to
hire a vessel, which should accompany the English ship
on its return, and should bring to New South Wales a
second cargo of necessaries. Meanwhile, the allowances
were yet further reduced, and the governor, having
reserved 300 bushels of wheat for seed, gave up 300 lbs.
weight of flour, which was his own private property, for
the public use; besides which, the expedients of fishing
and shooting wild animals were tried, but with no great
success. Crime appeared rather to increase than to
diminish with the increase of temptation and opportunities;
and at this awful period of trial for the whole
population, it was judged necessary to execute one
criminal. A female convict was at this time robbed of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
her week&#8217;s provisions, and she was left to subsist upon
the bounty of others, since it was impossible to replace
them from the public store; and if it was a cruel offence
of <em>one</em> to rob the poor woman, it reflected credit upon
<em>many</em>, that, under such circumstances, she was preserved
from starvation.</p>

<p>At length, after six months of indescribable anxiety and
privation, the expected signal was made, and a boat was
sent off (in very rough weather) to direct the ship how to
get safely into the harbour. It was the transport-ship,
the <em>Lady Juliana</em>, which had been no less than ten
months upon the voyage, and which brought news
of the almost total destruction of another ship, the
<em>Guardian</em>, which had been sent out previously, and well
supplied with every thing necessary for a rising colony.
<em>The Lady Juliana</em> brought very little addition to the
supplies, compared with the additional number of consumers,
above 200 female convicts, which she had with
her; these had been sent upon the reckoning of the
<em>Guardian&#8217;s</em> stores arriving beforehand; and if this had
been permitted, probably the colony would never more
have experienced want. It was unfortunate, at a
time when a cargo of any thing but of convicts would
have been serviceable, that scarcely any thing else
should arrive. Before the end of June, however, another
ship laden with provisions arrived, after having very
narrowly escaped a wreck off the heads at the entrance
of Port Jackson; and upon the welcome arrival of this
supply the immediate scarcity ceased. Three other
vessels shortly followed, and things were thus for a time
restored to their former course; but repeated trials,
arising from want of provisions, were afterwards, at
intervals, the lot of the colony. In 1794, on the very
day when the doors of the provision-store were closed,
and the convicts had received their last allowance which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
remained, the signal for a sail was made; and it was the
third day before the two vessels then in sight could be
got into the harbour, but their arrival brought comparative
abundance to the starving population of 3,000
people, who were beginning seriously to reckon up how
far their live stock would go towards the supply of their
necessities. Several other similar seasons of famine
have been recorded, and it is curious and instructive to
look back upon the day of small things in a country
abundant as New South Wales at present is in the necessaries,
comforts, and even luxuries, of life.</p>

<p>The state of health in which many of the convicts
reached their place of exile, and the numbers of them
which never reached it at all, were deplorable facts,
proving too truly that men may be found capable of
doing any thing for the hope of profit. A certain sum
per head was paid by the government for each convict,
and thus the dead became more profitable to the contractors
than the living were; for the expenses of the
former were less, while the stipulated payments were
the same in both cases. Out of three ships 274 convicts
died on the voyage,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and when they had landed, there
were no less than 488 persons in the hospital. Neglect
like this of the miserable creatures who had broken their
country&#8217;s laws, most justly awakens our feelings of
indignation; and these are righteous feelings, but let
them not be confined to the <em>bodily</em> neglect to which,
in a comparatively few instances at first, the convicts
were exposed. Let us recollect, with sorrow rather than
indignation, how many thousands of these unhappy creatures
have, down to the present time, been left to perish, in a
spiritual sense, and that, likewise, from motives of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
profit, for fear of the outcry of want of economy being
excited in a wealthy nation, if sufficient means of spiritual
instruction were provided for our banished fellow-countrymen!</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the three transports, those of
the convicts that were in tolerable health were settled at
Rose Hill, and the town now called Paramatta was laid
out; and the commencement of a system of free settlers
was provided for, although the retired soldiers, those
parties for whom it was originally intended, were not
usually very persevering or successful in their attempts
at farming. In September, 1790, Governor Phillip received
that wound of which mention has been made
elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and this season the dry weather was so
excessive, that the gardens and fields of corn were parched
up for want of moisture. Five convicts left Paramatta
in a boat, and got out of the harbour without being
discovered, having provisions for a week with them, and
purposing to steer for Otaheite!<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> A search was made
for them, but in vain, and beyond doubt they must have
perished miserably. At various times, the convicts,
especially some of the Irish, set off to the northwards,
meaning to travel by the interior of New Holland
<em>overland to China</em>; and many were either starved to
death or else killed by the natives, while pursuing this
vain hope of escape from thraldom.</p>

<p>The next event of importance to the infant colony was
the arrival, towards the close of 1791, of what is called
the <em>second</em> fleet, consisting of no less than ten ships, and
having on board upwards of 2,000 convicts, with provisions
and other necessaries. These ships came dropping
into the harbour at short intervals after each other,
and their arrival, together with the needful preparations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
for the additional numbers brought by them, gave an
air of bustle and life to the little town of Sydney. Various
public works and buildings had been carried on, especially
some tanks were cut in the rocks to serve as
reservoirs in dry seasons, and at Paramatta between
forty and fifty fresh acres were expected to be got ready
for Indian corn this year. By his Majesty&#8217;s ship
<em>Gorgon</em>, certain needful instruments and powers for
carrying on the government of the colony were sent, and
amongst others the public seal of New South Wales.
Two or three of the vessels which had arrived from
England, were employed, after discharging their cargoes,
in the whale-fishery, and not altogether without success;
so early did British enterprise turn itself to that
occupation, which has latterly become most profitable in
those regions. During this year, the governor for the
first time exercised a power which had only recently
been given him, and several convicts were, on account
of their good behaviour, released from their state of
bondage, on condition of their not returning to England
before the term of their sentences had expired. Various
allotments of land were also given to those whose terms
had already expired, and who signified their willingness
to become settlers in this new country. At the close of
the year 1791, nearly four years from the first landing of
the British in Port Jackson, the public live stock consisted
of one aged stallion, one mare, two young stallions,
two colts, sixteen cows, two calves, one ram, fifty ewes,
six lambs, one boar, fourteen sows, and twenty-two
pigs. The cultivated ground at Paramatta amounted to
three hundred acres in maize, forty-four in wheat, six in
barley, one in oats, four in vines, eighty-six in garden-ground,
and seventeen in cultivation by the soldiers of
the New South Wales Corps. Thus humble were the
beginnings, even after some time, of that wealth in flocks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and herds for which our Australian colonies are now so
justly celebrated.</p>

<p>Very little, meanwhile, is recorded of the chaplain,
Mr. Johnson, or his doings, but that little is to his credit.
He was, it appears, in the habit of relieving from his
own private bounty the convicts who were most in need;
and some of them spread abroad a report that this was
done from funds raised by subscription in the mother country;
and upon the strength of this notion, in the
spirit which the poorer classes in England too often
exhibit, they chose to claim relief as though it were their
<em>just right</em>. This false notion was publicly contradicted,
and Mr. Johnson thought it necessary that the convicts
should know that it was to his bounty alone that they
were indebted for these gifts, and that, consequently,
the partakers of them were to be of his own selection.
Another instance of the kindness of Mr. Johnson, and
of the evil return it met with, has also been recorded,
and though it occurred some years afterwards, in 1797,
it may be noticed here. It happened that among the
convicts there was found one who had been this gentleman&#8217;s
schoolfellow, and the chaplain, feeling compassion
for his fallen condition, had taken him into his service,
and treated him with the utmost confidence and indulgence.
Soon afterwards, it was rumoured that this man
had taken an impression of the key of the store-room
in clay, from which he had procured another key to fit
the lock. Mr. Johnson scarcely credited the story, but
at length he consented that a constable should be concealed
in the house on a Sunday, when all the family,
except this person, would be engaged in Divine service.
The plan succeeded too well. Supposing that all was
secure, the ungrateful wretch applied his key to the
door of the store-room, and began to plunder it of all
the articles he chose to take, until the constable, leaving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
his hiding-place, put an end to the robbery by making
the thief his prisoner.</p>

<p>The attention of Mr. Johnson to his ministerial and
public duties appears to have continued in a quiet and
regular way, but its fruits were by no means so manifest
as could have been wished. In 1790 he complained to
the authorities of the want of attendance at divine
service, which, it must be observed, was generally
performed in the open air, exposed alike to the wind
and rain, or burning sun; and then it was ordered that
a certain portion of provisions should be taken off from
the allowance of each person who might absent himself
from prayers without giving a reasonable excuse. And
thus, we may suppose, a better congregation was
secured; but, alas! from what a motive were they
induced to draw near their God. And how many are
there, it is to be feared, in our country parishes in
England, whose great inducement to attend their church
is the fact that the clergyman generally has certain gifts
to distribute: how common a fault, in short, has it been
in all ages and in all countries for men to seek Christ
from no higher motive than that they may &ldquo;eat of the
loaves and be filled!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In proof of the single voice
that was raised in the wilderness of New South Wales
being not altogether an empty and ineffectual sound, we
are told that in 1790, when the female convicts who
arrived by the <em>Lady Juliana</em> attended divine service for
the first time, Mr. Johnson, with much propriety, in his
discourse, touched upon their situation so forcibly as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
draw tears from many of them, who were not yet
hardened enough to be altogether insensible to truth.
Another instance of very praiseworthy zeal was afforded
by the voluntary visit of the chaplain of New South
Wales in 1791 to Norfolk Island, which small colony
had never yet been favoured even with the temporary
presence of a minister of the Church of Christ.</p>

<p>But a yet better proof of the chaplain&#8217;s earnestness
was given, after the colony had been settled for six
years, in his building a church,&mdash;the first that was raised
in New Holland for the purposes of christian worship.
Even now, we often may hear and lament the ignorance
which chooses to reckon the <em>clergy</em> as the <em>Church</em>, and
which looks upon the efforts recently made in favour of
church extension, as lying quite beyond the province
of the laity; and this deplorable ignorance was much
more common in Mr. Johnson&#8217;s days.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Accordingly,
to the disgrace of the colony and of the government at
home, no church was raised during six years, and when
at last that object was accomplished, it was by the
private purse and the single efforts of an individual,&mdash;the
chaplain of the colony. The building was in a very
humble style, made of wood and thatched, and it is said
to have cost Mr. Johnson only 40<em>l.</em>; but all this merely
serves to show how easily the good work might have
been before done, how inexcusable it was to leave its
accomplishment to one individual. A few months before
this necessary work was undertaken the colony had been
visited by two Spanish ships, and it is possible that an
observation made by the Romish priest belonging to one
of these ships may have had some effect towards raising
the first church built at Sydney. At the time when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Spanish ships were in the harbour, the English chaplain
performed divine service wherever he could find a shady
spot; and the Spanish priest observing that, during so
many years no church had been built, lifted up his eyes
with astonishment, declaring (truly), that, had the place
been settled by his nation, a house of God would have
been erected before any house for man. How disgraceful
to the English nation, how injurious to our
Reformed Church, that an observation like this, coming
from the lips of one who belonged to a corrupt and
idolatrous church, should be so true, so incapable of
contradiction! However, if the remark had any effect
in exciting the efforts of the Protestant chaplain, and in
thus supplying at length a want so palpable as that
of a house of God in the colony, it was by no means
uttered in vain; and supposing it to be so, this is not a
solitary instance of our Church and her members having
been aroused into activity by the taunts and attacks of
those that are opposed to her.</p>

<p>Upon the opening of the humble building, which had
thus tardily been raised for the purposes of divine
worship, and to consecrate which according to the
beautiful forms of our English church there was no
bishop in the colony, the chaplain preached a suitable
sermon, we are informed; but, if it may be judged from
the scanty record that is preserved of it, this discourse
partook of the cold and worldly spirit of the age in
which it was delivered. Mr. Johnson began well with
impressing upon his hearers the necessity of holiness in
every place, and then lamented the urgency of public
works having prevented the erection of a church sooner.
As though a building for the public worship of Almighty
God were not the most urgent of all public works in
every christian community! He next went on to
declare, that his <em>only</em> motive in coming forward in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
business was that of establishing a place sheltered from
bad weather, and from the summer-heats, where public
worship might be performed. The uncertainty of a
place where they might attend had prevented many from
coming, but he hoped that now the attendance would be
regular.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Surely, the worthy chaplain might have had
and avowed a higher motive for building a house of
God, than that of keeping men from the wind, and the
rain, and the sun; and, undoubtedly, as the inconvenience
of the former system was no good excuse for
absence from divine service, so neither could the comparative
convenience of the new arrangement be at all
a proper motive for attendance upon it.</p>

<p>However, many allowances are to be made for Mr.
Johnson, and it becomes us, while we condemn the
faults, to spare the persons, of the men of that and of
other past generations; especially when we look at our
own age, and see, notwithstanding the improvement
that has unquestionably taken place, how many conspicuous
faults there are prevailing among us, which
those of future generations will justly pity and condemn.
It may be well, before the subject of the church raised
by Mr. Johnson is finally quitted, to acquaint the reader
with its fate. In 1798, after having stood only five
years, it was discovered one evening to be on fire, and,
all efforts to save it proving useless, from the combustible
nature of the materials, it was consumed in an
hour. &ldquo;This was a great loss,&rdquo; observes the historian
of the colony, &ldquo;for during the working days of the
week the building was used as a school, in which from
150 to 200 children were educated, under the immediate
inspection of Mr. Johnson. As this building stood
alone, and no person was suffered to remain in it after
the school hours, there was not a doubt but the atrocious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
act was the effect of design, and in consequence of
an order enforcing attendance on divine service.&rdquo; The
governor, however, with praiseworthy zeal, would not
suffer a single Sunday to be lost, but ordered a new
store-house, which was just finished, to be fitted up for
a church. One brief observation may here be added.
How powerful a witness do the enemies of Christ&#8217;s
Church, and of our English branch of it, bear to the
usefulness and effect of its doctrine, even in its most
helpless and lowest condition, by the ceaseless and
unscrupulous pains which they take in trying to silence
its testimony!</p>

<p>No apology is necessary for detaining the reader so
long upon these little details, since if the religious state
and progress of an infant colony be not an interesting
feature in its history, what can we hope to find in it that
is deserving of the attention of a thoughtful and well-regulated
mind? But we return now to the temporal
affairs of New South Wales. The year 1792, which
began with reduced rations of provisions, was a time of
great suffering and scarcity in the colony, nor was it
until the latter part of the year that any relief for the
wants of the settlers arrived. Meanwhile the mortality
that took place was very alarming, and notwithstanding
the sickness that prevailed, there was no abatement in
wickedness and crime. At one time during this year
no less than fifty-three persons were missing, many of
whom never returned, having perished, no doubt, miserably
in the woods, while seeking for a new settlement,
or endeavouring to find their way to China! An execution
for theft took place in January, and the unhappy
man declared that hunger had tempted him to commit
the crime for which he suffered. Many instances of
profligacy among the convicts occurred, but one stands
forth distinguished by especial wickedness. A woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
had been trusted to carry to the bakehouse the allowance
of flour belonging to two others; and after having
run in debt for flour taken up on their account, she
mixed a quantity of pounded stone, in the proportion of
two-thirds of grit to one of flour, with the meal belonging
to the other women.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Fortunately, the deceit was found
out before the flour was mixed with other meal at the
bakehouse, and the culprit was sentenced to wear an
iron collar for six months. In April, a convict was
killed by a blow from the limb of a tree, which fell on
his head as he passed under it, and fractured his skull.
He died on the spot, having earned from those who knew
him the character of being so great a reprobate, that he
was scarcely ever known to speak without an oath, or
without calling on his Maker to witness the truth of the
lie he was about to utter. Are these poor creatures, if
may be again asked, to be cast out from their own
country, and left (as they too often have been,) to their
own evil devices and to Satan&#8217;s temptations, without
involving the nation that has thus treated them in a
load of guilt too fearful to contemplate?</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1792 the harvest was
gathered in from the 1540 acres of cleared ground,
which were sown in the preceding seed-time. The produce
was tolerably good, and since no less than 3470
acres of land had already been granted to settlers, it was
hoped that before very long the colony might cease to
be almost entirely dependent for its support upon the
precarious supply which it received from ships. The
colonists then learned by sad experience what many
Englishmen in the present day seem unwilling to believe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
that <em>it is one of the worst evils to be dependent upon other
countries for daily bread</em>. In December, the governor,
Captain Phillip, left the colony from ill health, having
acted with much prudence and vigour during his
administration, and leaving behind him a respectable
character; he returned to England, where his services
were rewarded by a pension of 400<em>l.</em> a-year, and he
retired to Bath, at which city he died. His activity in
exploring the neighbouring country and discovering its
capabilities, his courage and firmness on many very
trying occasions, his steady opposition to every proposal
of abandoning the settlement, together with his
general character, sufficiently entitle his memory to
regard and respect from those who are now living in
New South Wales, and reaping in comparative ease the
fruit of that harvest which it cost him and others great
pains and many trials to sow.</p>

<p>Before the first Governor of New South Wales left
that country, he had the satisfaction of seeing its
prospects of a future sufficiency of provisions very
greatly improved; and a work of charity, the hospital at
Paramatta, was completed in the month before that in
which he sailed. With the year 1793 began a new
government, for as no successor had been appointed at
home to Captain Phillip, the chief power now came,
according to what had been previously provided, into
the hands of Major Grose, of the New South Wales
Corps, who assumed the style of Lieutenant-Governor.
During nearly three years things continued in this state;
only Major Grose left the settlement, and was succeeded
by Captain Paterson; nor was it until 1795 that a
regular successor to the first governor arrived in the
colony. In this period many things occurred which
were, no doubt, of the highest interest to the settlers at
the time, but few events which deserve our particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
notice now. A fire, which destroyed a house worth
15<em>l.</em>, and thirty bushels of new wheat;&mdash;the alternate
scarcity and comparative abundance of provisions;&mdash;the
arrival or departure of ships from the harbour;&mdash;the
commission of the first murder in the colony, and
other sad accounts of human depravity and its punishment;&mdash;the
gradual improvement and extension of the
colony;&mdash;the first sale by auction of a farm of twenty-five
acres for the sum of 13<em>l.</em>:&mdash;these and similar subjects
occupy the history of New South Wales, not merely
during the three years that elapsed between Governor
Phillip&#8217;s departure and the arrival of his successor, but
also during the long period of gradual but increasing
improvement which followed the last event.</p>

<p>Yet, while the improvement of the little colony was
evidently steady and increasing, when its affairs are
regarded in a temporal point of view, in morals its
progress appeared to be directly contrary; and, painful
though it be to dwell upon the sins and follies of men,
whose bodies have long since passed away to their
parent dust, and their souls returned to God who gave
them, nevertheless, there are many wholesome lessons
of instruction and humiliation to be gathered from the
history of human depravity in New South Wales. One
of the crying sins of the mother country,&mdash;a sin now
very much confined to the lower classes of society, but
fifty years ago equally common among all classes,&mdash;is
that of <em>drunkenness</em>; and it could scarcely be expected
that the outcast daughter in Australia would be less
blamable in this respect than the mother from which
she sprang.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Accordingly, we find that as soon as it
was possible to procure spirits, at however great a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
sacrifice, they were obtained, and intoxication was
indulged in,&mdash;if such brutality deserves the name of
indulgence,&mdash;to an awful extent. Whether all that a
writer very intimately acquainted with New South
Wales urges against the officers of the New South Wales
Corps be true or not, so far as their dealings in spirituous
liquors are concerned, there can be no question that
these mischievous articles became almost entirely the
current coin of the settlement, and were the source of
worldly gain to a few, while they proved the moral ruin
of almost all, in the colony. But, without giving entire
credit to all the assertions of Dr. Lang, who deals very
much in hasty notions and exaggerated opinions,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> we
may sorrowfully acknowledge that, if the convicts in
New South Wales gave way in a horrible manner to
drunkenness and its attendant sins, the upper classes,
in general, either set them a bad example, or made a
plunder of them by pandering to their favourite vice.
The passion for liquor, it is stated by Collins,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> operated
like a mania, there being nothing which the people
would not risk to obtain it: and while spirits were to
be had, those who did any extra labour refused to be
paid in money, or in any other article than spirits,
which were then so scarce as to be sold at six shillings a
bottle. So eagerly were fermented liquors sought after,
and so little was the value of money in a place where
neither the comforts nor luxuries of life could be
bought, that the purchaser has been often known, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
early days of the colony, to name himself a price for the
article he wanted, fixing it as high again as would otherwise
have been required of him. When the few boat-builders
and shipwrights in the colony had leisure, they
employed themselves in building boats for those that
would pay them their price, namely, five or six gallons of
spirits. It could be no matter of surprise that boats
made by workmen so paid should be badly put together,
and scarcely seaworthy.</p>

<p>But, however commonly the standard of value might
be measured by spirituous liquors, yet it is evident that
these, being themselves procurable for money, could not
altogether supersede the desire of money itself. Hence
arose those numerous acts of theft and depredation,
that improvident thirst after present gain, that total
disregard of future consequences by which many of the
first inhabitants of the colony were disgraced and
ruined. The contagion of evil example forced its way
into Government House, and the steward of Governor
Hunter became an awful instance of the mischief of bad
society. Against this he had been often cautioned by
his master, but to no purpose, until at length he was
discovered abusing the unlimited confidence which had
been placed in him, and making use of the governor&#8217;s
name in a most iniquitous manner. At this discovery
the wretched victim of evil communication retired to a
shrubbery in his master&#8217;s garden, and shot himself
through the head.</p>

<p>From the love of money, which no mean authority
has pronounced to be &ldquo;the root of all evil,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> arose
likewise that spirit of gambling, which ended in murder
on one occasion before the settlement had existed more
than six years; and which on many occasions was the
manifest cause of misery and ruin to those in whom this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
evil spirit had taken up its abode. To such excess was
the pursuit of gambling carried among the convicts, that
some had been known, after losing provisions, money,
and all their spare clothing, to have staked and lost the
very clothes on their wretched backs, standing in the
midst of their associates as degraded, and as careless of
their degradation, as the natives of the country which
these gamblers disgraced. Money was their principal
object, for with money they could purchase spirits, or
whatever else their passions made them covet, or the
colony could furnish. These unhappy men have been
seen to play at their favourite games for six, eight, and
ten dollars each game; and those who were not expert
at these, instead of pence, tossed up for dollars!<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>FURTHER PROGRESS OF THE COLONY TO 1821.</strong></p>


<p>The month of August, 1795, was marked in the annals
of New South Wales by the arrival of the second governor
of the colony, Captain Hunter, who continued
five years in power, and returned to England in the
year 1800, after having seen the colony over which he
was placed prospering and thriving enough in worldly
matters, though in other more important points it
continued poor and naked indeed. It was a great object
with the new governor to check and restrain that love of
liquor, which he saw working so much mischief among
his people; and several private stills were found and
destroyed, to the great regret of their owners, who made
twice as large a profit from the spirit distilled by them
out of wheat, as they would have been able to have
gained, had they sold their grain for the purpose of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
making bread. So common was the abuse of paying
wages in liquor,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that it was pretended that the produce
of these stills was only to be paid away in labour, whereas
it was sold for a means of intoxication to any person who
would bring ready money for it. At the commencement
of harvest, in the November immediately following the
arrival of Governor Hunter, a regulation was made by
that gentleman, which showed that the infant colony
was now making rapid strides towards that point of
advancement and independence, from which ignorant
and designing men are at present labouring to thrust
down the mother country. New South Wales was, in
1795, just beginning to supply its inhabitants with corn,
and Governor Hunter wisely thought that the increasing
abundance of the produce would now bear some little
decrease in the high prices hitherto paid for new grain
at the public store. England, in 1843, is able to supply
its inhabitants with food, (except in scarce years, when
corn is let in at prices varying with the degree of scarcity,)
and many Englishmen unwisely think that this advantage
and independence may be safely bartered away&mdash;for
what?&mdash;for <em>very low prices</em>, and, their constant companions,
<em>very low wages</em>, and <em>very great and universal
distress</em>!<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Another addition to the means, which the country was
beginning to possess of maintaining its inhabitants, was
made by the regular, though far from rapid, increase of
live stock, which, in spite of all obstacles, and notwithstanding
great carelessness and ignorance on the part of
many of those that kept it, continued to thrive and
multiply.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But, besides the cattle to be seen upon
the various farms and allotments in the settlement, a
considerable herd of wild cattle were found, soon after
Governor Hunter&#8217;s arrival, on the banks of the Nepean
River, about thirty miles from Sydney, in a district still
bearing the name of the Cow Pastures. These animals
were clearly ascertained to have sprung from a few tame
cattle which had strayed away from the colony at its
first foundation; and the governor, pleased at this discovery,
himself paid a visit to the Cow Pastures, where
he found a very fine herd, upwards of forty in number,
grazing in a pleasant and rich pasturage. The whole
number of them was upwards of sixty, but the governor&#8217;s
party were attacked by a furious bull, which, in self-defence,
they were obliged to kill. The country where
these animals were seen was remarkably pleasant to the
eye; every where was thick and luxuriant grass growing;
the trees were thinly scattered, and free from underwood,
except in particular spots; in several beautiful flats large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
ponds were found, covered with ducks and black swans,
the margins of which were fringed with beautiful shrubs,
and the ground rose from these levels into hills of easy
ascent. The advantages of having an increasing number
of wild cattle within so short a distance of the settlement
were obvious enough, and the government resolved to
protect them to the utmost of its power. Accordingly,
it was ordered that no part of the fertile tract of which
these animals were in possession should be granted out
to settlers; and at length the herds became too numerous
even for the 60,000 acres, which the district was supposed
to contain. But, in 1813 and the two following years,
so severe a drought prevailed, that vast numbers of
them died; and afterwards the government consented to
grant away the land, and the remainder of the herds
betook themselves to the mountainous ranges beyond.</p>

<p>Captain Hunter was rather fond of exploring the unknown
country which extended behind, or to the northward
or southward of, the narrow limits of the British
colony: and during his administration its boundaries
were considerably enlarged, and some valuable
discoveries were made. One of the most important of
these was a discovery which served to prove the claim
of the colony to be called New South Wales, from its
resemblance to the country whence its name was taken,
in one production at least. In 1796, some persons
returned from fishing in a bay considerably to the northward
of Port Jackson, and brought with them several
large pieces of <em>coal</em>, which they said that they had found
at some little distance from the beach, lying in quantities
on the surface of the ground. This was the first knowledge
obtained by the settlers of the value of the productions
of the coast at the mouth of the river Hunter,
and at the place where coals were found so abundantly
there now exists a township, furnishing the whole colony
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
with a supply of that useful article, besides having a large
trade in lime, which is made from the oyster-shells that
are found there in immense quantities. The appropriate
name of this township is Newcastle.</p>

<p>Many needful and praiseworthy regulations were made
by Captain Hunter, who endeavoured to enforce attendance
on Divine service, and the proper observance of
the Sunday; and who took great pains also to discover
and punish those encroachments upon the public stores
which had been continually made. The convicts whose
time of punishment had expired, but who were unable
to get a passage to England, were frequently more
troublesome and ill-disposed, being less under authority
than the others were. These emancipists, as they were
called, would occasionally indeed withdraw from receiving
the ration allowed by Government; but then it was only
in the hope of avoiding labour, and living by pillage.
Or else these men, together with others not less
ill-disposed than themselves, would play every possible
trick to obtain their allowance from the public stores,
when they were not entitled, or to get more than their
allowances, when they had a certain claim. To put a
check upon such practices, the governor, in 1796, had a
general muster of all descriptions of people in every
part of the colony at the same hour, so that it would be
no longer possible, as on former occasions, for one
person to manage to answer to his name in two different
places, and to draw provisions from both stores. Very
shortly after this general muster, the governor made a
journey to the banks of the River Hawkesbury, where
there is some of the richest land in the colony, but on
his return, he had the mortification of seeing a stack
of wheat belonging to Government burnt, containing
800 bushels, and it was not certain whether this fire
was accidental, since the destruction thus caused made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
room for as many bushels as were destroyed, which must
be purchased from the settlers who had wheat to sell.
In reading of these atrocious acts&mdash;for if <em>this</em> fire was not
intentional, <em>others</em> undoubtedly were&mdash;the inhabitants of
England must not plume themselves upon their superiority
to the outcasts of their country in New South
Wales. Unhappily, the word <em>incendiarism</em> has become
familiar to English ears, and, ever since the evil spirits
of agitation and rebellion have been dallied with, they
have made their deeds of darkness visible, from time to
time, by the awful midnight fires which they have kindled
in the land.</p>

<p>But it was not only in checking the outrages of the
British inhabitants of New South Wales, that the
governor was actively employed; the natives were also
exceedingly troublesome, especially at the valuable farms
on the Hawkesbury. Vigorous efforts were made to
prevent that disorder, and disregard of private property,
which seemed so prevailing; and certainly Governor
Hunter appears to have been an active and energetic,
but, as might be expected in a colony like that over
which he was placed, not altogether a <em>popular</em> ruler.
The vices of the lower classes were, in too many instances,
found profitable, more or less directly, to those
who are termed the upper classes in the settlement;
and since both classes became to a fearful degree sensual
and covetous, the evil was doubly aggravated by example
and contagion. And when we consider, that, at
that time, the population of the colony might almost
have been divided into those who <em>drank</em> rum, and those
who <em>sold</em> it;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> when we recollect the covetousness of all
classes, the hardened wickedness of many of the convicts,
the idleness of the settlers or soldiers, the peculiar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
character of the natives, and the infant state of the
British colony, it must be confessed, that the requisites
of every good governor,&mdash;a wise head, a stout heart,
and a steady hand,&mdash;were preeminently needful in the
governor of New South Wales.</p>

<p>The list of crimes, which were continually occurring
during the five years of Captain Hunter&#8217;s being governor,
was a fearful and appalling one; nor can we wonder at
the wish expressed by the historian of the early days of
the colony, that future annalists may find a pleasanter
field to travel in, without having their steps beset every
moment with murderers, robbers, and incendiaries.
Twice during Governor Hunter&#8217;s administration was a
public gaol purposely destroyed by fire; once the gaol
at Sydney suffered, although there were twenty prisoners
confined there, who being mostly in irons were with
difficulty saved; and the second time, the Paramatta
gaol was destroyed, and one of the prisoners was
scorched to death. Several of the settlers declined to
pay anything towards the building of a new gaol, and it
was not long a matter of doubt which article would be
most likely to bear a productive tax; so a duty of one
shilling per gallon was imposed upon spirits, sixpence
on wine, and threepence upon porter or strong beer, to
be applied to the above purpose. Building gaols is,
beyond question, a necessary thing, especially in a
colony chiefly formed of convicts: and perhaps a tax
upon intoxicating liquors is no bad mode of procuring
the means of erecting them, for thus the sober and industrious
are not heavily taxed to provide for the support
and punishment of the profligate and wicked. Nevertheless,
if Christ&#8217;s religion be true, there is a surer and
better way of checking crime, than by trusting to gaols
and police alone; but, unhappily, this more excellent
way of reforming the morals of mankind, has, in modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
times, found little favour with the great ones of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Certainly the power of the Gospel and Church of
Christ had no scope allowed it for its blessed effects,
when to a population, consisting in 1803 of 7097 souls,
and constantly on the increase, besides being scattered
over an immense tract of country, <em>one clergyman only</em> was
allowed during seven years to wage, single-handed and
alone, the war against evil. There were, indeed, many Irish
Roman Catholics among the convicts, and one of these,
named Harrold, was a Romish priest, but his character
was too little to be trusted for him to be of any great
spiritual advantage even to those of his own communion.</p>

<p>In the year 1800, Governor Hunter left the settlement
for England, and was succeeded in his office by Captain
King, who had been Lieutenant-governor of Norfolk
Island, and had conducted with great care and success
the establishment of that smaller colony. However,
Norfolk Island was abandoned altogether during the
government of Captain King and his successor; and it
is said this step was taken in compliance with the advice
of the former gentleman. It was a saying attributed to
him, that &ldquo;he could not make farmers of pickpockets;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
and whatever truth there might be in this maxim, certainly
it appears that the progress of agriculture was
unfavourable, and that the colony continued still subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to seasons of scarcity, approaching to famine, and obliged
to put up with coarse loaves, which were feelingly called
<em>scrubbing brushes</em>;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and was always in a state of
dependence upon foreign supplies for daily bread. But if
there were no <em>corn laws</em>, there was abundance of
discontent and misery in the colony of New South Wales;
and during the time of Captain King&#8217;s government, a
rebellion broke out among the convicts, who had been
induced by some of their number, rebels from Ireland,
to <em>strike for their liberty</em>. The revolt was soon crushed
by the military, but not without the loss of life to some
of the unhappy men who had been partakers in it.</p>

<p>The six years during which Captain King held the
office of governor of New South Wales, under the crown
of Great Britain and Ireland, were rendered remarkable,
as has been already stated, by the partial abandonment
of the colony of Norfolk Island; and, it may be added,
yet more remarkable by the commencement of another
settlement, the first ever attempted in Van Diemen&#8217;s
Land.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island, which is situated about 1000 miles from
the eastern shore of New Holland, was settled almost
immediately after the first foundations of Sydney had
been laid; and although but a speck in the ocean, and
without any safe or convenient landing-place, the first-named
colony was altogether more flourishing in its
early days than the other. The natural fertility of the
land, the abundance of food supplied by the birds of
providence,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the number of free settlers, and the wise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
arrangements of Lieutenant-governor King, may all be
recollected among the reasons of the superior prosperity
of Norfolk Island. However, its career of prosperity
was doomed to be but a very short one. Partly upon
the plea of its having no convenient harbour, and partly
because of its very limited extent, it was decided by the
home government that it should be abandoned, and this
decision was acted upon in 1805 and 1807, when the
free settlers were compelled to leave the island, which
remained unoccupied for about twenty years, and at the
end of this time it was made a penal settlement for the
punishment of refractory convicts, which it still
continues to be,&mdash;one of the finest spots upon earth
degraded into the abode of the vilest of human beings,&mdash;the
scum of the outcast population of a great and
civilized nation. And, to heighten the horror of the
contrast between things natural and things spiritual in
Norfolk Island, there was not, until recently, a single
minister of Christ&#8217;s Church resident within its bounds; so
that where Nature&#8217;s sun was shining most beauteously,
and Nature&#8217;s sights and sounds were most lovely and
enchanting, there the outcast souls<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of a rich and
<em>christian</em> population were left to perish, without being
able to catch a ray of the Sun of Righteousness, without a
chance (so to speak) of hearing the sound of the gospel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
of Christ: they might there listen in their lonely wretchedness
to the rise and fall of the tide of that ocean by which
their little island is surrounded, but they were shut out
for ever, it would seem, from the voice of the great
multitude of the faithful, &ldquo;as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah,
for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relinquishment of the settlement at Norfolk
Island, under Governor King&#8217;s administration, after the
money that had been spent upon it, and the success
which was attending that expenditure, might well appear
to be a hasty and imprudent act; but, undoubtedly, in its
consequences it turned out beneficial to Great Britain.
Instead of Norfolk Island, another much larger, and far
more important spot, which might otherwise have been
occupied by foreigners, was colonized by British subjects;
and Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, from the extent of its present
wealth and population, besides its nearer resemblance
than other Australian colonies to the climate of the
mother country, may justly be esteemed one of the
most valuable possessions of the British crown. The
history of the foundation of this new colony may here
be shortly detailed. It was resolved that a fresh settlement,
which might be free from the objections brought
against Norfolk Island, should be formed; and, in 1804,
Port Phillip, an extensive harbour on the southern coast
of New Holland, was the spot chosen for this purpose.
But Colonel Collins, who had the command of the
party of colonists, found the eastern side of Port Phillip
very little suited to his object; and without examining
its western side, which has been lately very rapidly and
successfully settled, the colonel sailed at once along the
western coast of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, took possession of
that extensive island in the name of his Britannic
Majesty, and, after various surveys, decided upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
spot where Hobart Town now stands, for his headquarters.
The little settlement then consisted only of a
few gentlemen holding official situations, fifty marines,
and four hundred prisoners. The place selected for
headquarters was well chosen, being upon the Derwent, a
beautiful and navigable river, and having a good supply
of water. In the same year, 1804, another settlement
was formed on the opposite, or northern, side of Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land; it was situated at the mouth of the
River Tamar, near George Town, and was called York
Town, but it was afterwards abandoned. The usual
trials to which newly-planted colonies are exposed, fell
also to the lot of that settled by Colonel Collins in Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land; but its struggles into life were by no
means so intense, or so prolonged, as those of its sister
colony. At one time when a disappointment occurred in
the usual supplies, the hind-quarters of kangaroos were
received into His Majesty&#8217;s store, at sixpence per pound,
and it is said that in six months no less than 15,000lbs.
of this meat were there tendered. After some years of
occasional scarcity, during which, once, even kangaroo
flesh was sold at one shilling and sixpence the pound, and
sea-weed, or any other eatable vegetable, was equally
dear, the colony began to take root and to increase, still
continuing, however, its original character of a penal
settlement&mdash;a place of punishment for the convicted felons
of New South Wales. Cattle and live stock rapidly increased,
land became more and more cultivated, houses
were built, farms enclosed, free emigrants began to arrive,
Hobart Town became a place of some trade and importance,
and at last, in 1821, or thereabouts, <em>only seventeen
years</em> after the first establishment of the colony,
St. David&#8217;s Church, at Hobart Town, was, we read, &ldquo;completed
and opened.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> What attention was paid to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
spiritual welfare of the poor creatures in this new penal
colony during the long interval that elapsed before the
occurrence of that great event, it seems hard to say;
but, judging from what we have already seen, we may
be quite certain of this, that <em>no less care</em> was taken of
them, than had formerly been bestowed upon those of a
similar character in Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>While Captain King held the government of New
South Wales, a subject began to attract the notice of the
colonial authorities, which afterwards proved to be one
of the highest importance, both to the settlement and
likewise to the mother country, namely, the introduction
and increase of free settlers. According to Dr. Lang, the
first free settlers who emigrated to New South Wales
arrived there during Governor Hunter&#8217;s administration,
which began in August, 1795; but by other writers it
is stated that five settlers and their families arrived by
the <em>Bellona</em>, in January 1798, so that these may justly
be considered the first free emigrants that removed from
Europe to Australia.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The conditions under which
they engaged to settle were, that their passage out
should be provided by government, that an assortment
of tools and implements should be furnished them, that
they should be supplied for two years with provisions,
that their lands should be granted free of expense, and
that convicts should be assigned for their service, and
provided with provisions for two years, and clothing for
one. Besides these few emigrants, many of the soldiers
and officers, and some of the released convicts, had grants
of land given to them; but, generally speaking, their
agricultural efforts were not very successful, and <em>military
men</em> seemed as little capable of becoming good farmers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
as <em>pickpockets</em> were. Yet, as if to show what <em>might</em> have
been done by prudence and thrift, in many cases, a few
instances of proper carefulness and attendant success
are recorded; and one man, to whom, in common with
many others, Governor Phillip had given an ewe for
breeding, in 1792, having withstood all temptations to
part with this treasure, found himself, in 1799, possessed
of a flock of 116 sheep, and in a fair way of becoming
a man of property.</p>

<p>But there was an individual, whose name and history
are upon record, to whom the claim of a yet earlier
settlement, as a free person, must be assigned. His
history is instructive, and may be worth repeating, since
it is, probably, a specimen of what afterwards occurred
in a vast number of instances. Philip Schoeffer was
a German, who had been sent out with the first fleet
that ever sailed to New South Wales, in the capacity of
an agriculturist, and chiefly with a view to the cultivation
of tobacco (to supersede that of Virginia,) in the
proposed settlement. His first grant of land was one
hundred and forty acres; but, unhappily, he fell into
habits of intemperance, and got rid of it all. Afterwards,
he obtained another grant of fifty acres, in what now
forms a very valuable situation in the town of Sydney;
but this he was induced to give up to the Colonial
Government for public purposes, about the year 1807,
receiving in return twenty gallons of rum, which were
then worth 60<em>l.</em> and a grant of the same extent with his
former one, but situated at Pitt Water, one of the inlets
of Broken Bay&mdash;a large harbour to the northward of
Port Jackson. Schoeffer then married a wife, a Scotch
woman and a convict, and settled on his farm at Pitt
Water, where he lived many years; but old age, poverty,
and intemperance induced him to sell it by piecemeal,
and he died at last in the benevolent asylum or colonial

poor-house. This short history may serve to show
upon what mere accidents the foundation of wealth
frequently depends, and especially in a new country;
for, if the German could only have kept his farm of fifty
acres in Sydney for about thirty years longer, he or his
successors might actually have sold it for 100,000<em>l.</em>!</p>

<p>After the landing of the few free settlers already
mentioned, which took place while Captain Hunter was
governor, the next arrival deserving of notice appears
to have been about a dozen families of Scotch Presbyterians,
who established themselves under similar conditions
with the first emigrants, and whose place of abode
was near Portland Head, on the banks of the Hawkesbury.
These men seem to have been a quiet and orderly,
as well as a prudent, set of people; and their industry
was rewarded by success. The zeal and devotion which
were exhibited by them in religious matters were also
very praiseworthy, and not less so because, according
to Captain Bligh, it was the only case of the kind he had
ever heard of, during his government of the colony.
A building for public worship was erected by them,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> at
a cost of upwards of 400<em>l.</em>, and altogether the conduct
of these Scotch emigrants reflected credit upon the
country and religious body to which they belonged.
But, while we award to these persons the praise which
is their due, we are by no means entitled to place to the
account of their being Presbyterians the good order and
right feeling which they exhibited. Scotchmen are
proverbially more fond of colonization than Englishmen,
and hence it naturally occurred that almost the first
respectable settlers were Scotch farmers; but there is
no reason to question,&mdash;nay, experience has since
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
proved,&mdash;that Englishmen of similar character, and
placed in the like circumstances, can conduct themselves
not less piously and properly, and will not yield to the
disciples of John Calvin or John Knox in their reverence
and devotion for a more apostolical Church than that
of Scotland. However, it must be owned with sorrow
that these instances of religious feeling and zeal were by
no means common among the first settlers; nor is this
a subject of surprise, when we recollect that, even now,
Australia is frequently looked upon as a last refuge for
those who can do well nowhere else; and if it be thought
so now, much more must this impression have prevailed
in the days of its earlier settlers. But, from whatever
class, or with whatever failings, they might come, a few
fresh settlers continued from year to year to find their
way to the shores of New Holland; and, in due time,
the tide of emigration was destined to set full into that
quarter, carrying with it a portion of the population and
wealth of the mother country, together with all its
luxuries, its arts, its vices, and its virtues.</p>

<p>In August, 1806, Captain King resigned his office, and
was succeeded in the government of New South Wales
by Captain Bligh, also of the royal navy. His name is
well known from the history of the mutiny of the crew
in the ship <em>Bounty</em>, which he had formerly commanded;
and he was not less unfortunate on shore, in the art of
governing his fellow-creatures. With many good qualities
and excellent intentions, his manner of ruling men
was not either happy or successful. But before we
proceed to the great event in colonial history, which
brought to a sudden termination the reign of Governor
Bligh, it will be well to notice a remarkable occurrence
which happened soon after he came into power. The
banks of the river Hawkesbury have already been stated
to be distinguished for their fertility; and at this time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
they formed the chief source from which the supply of
wheat for the colony was drawn. Many acres of land
had been cleared there, and the whole district, with
smiling farms scattered about upon the rising banks of
the beautiful stream, offered one of the most pleasing
scenes in the whole settlement. But, within the first
year of the government of Captain Bligh, the farmers on
the Hawkesbury, and indeed the whole colony, were
doomed to undergo a severe trial.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In March 1799, the
river had been known to rise suddenly to the enormous
height of fifty feet, and the destruction of property which
had been then occasioned was very great.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> But now,
without any considerable rains having fallen upon the
eastern side of the Blue Mountains, between that range
and the sea, the river rose, in one place at least, to the
enormous height of ninety-three feet, so that buildings,
stock, or corn, which were not secured upon rising
ground equal in height to that of an ordinary church-tower,
must have been overwhelmed and borne away
by the flood. It is said that a settler, whose house stood
on an eminence at a beautiful bend of the Hawkesbury,
saw no less than thirty stacks of wheat at one time
floating down the stream during a flood, some of them
being covered with pigs and poultry, who had thus vainly
sought safety from the rising of the waters. The consequences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of this unexpected disaster were very calamitous,
and before the ensuing harvest could be begun, wheat
and Indian corn attained an equal value, and were sold
at 1<em>l.</em> 8<em>s.</em> or 1<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> per bushel. Even
eleven years afterwards,
when a similar overflow, though not equal to
&ldquo;<em>the great flood</em>,&rdquo; occurred, prices were raised enormously,
and but for an importation of wheat from Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land, they would have been very little short
of those in the year 1806. Governor Bligh appears to
have done all that a governor could do to lessen the
distress that prevailed, by ordering a number of the
cattle belonging to government to be slaughtered and
divided among the sufferers, and by encouraging, to the
utmost extent of his power, the cultivation of a large
breadth of land in wheat for the ensuing season. By
these means, under Divine Providence, the colony again
became able to supply itself with daily bread; a capability
of which, like many other blessings, nations scarcely
know the value and importance, until they are deprived,
or deprive themselves of it.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>From whatever cause it might arise,&mdash;whether from
his opposition to the practice of all the chief persons in
the colony making a profit by the sale of spirits,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>&mdash;or
from his dislike of the New South Wales Corps,&mdash;or from
his own harsh and tyrannical conduct,&mdash;whether, in
short, we listen to Governor Bligh&#8217;s admirers or enemies,
thus much is certain: he was excessively unpopular
with a large and powerful party of men in the settlement.
Without entering into the particulars of the extraordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
treatment to which his Majesty&#8217;s representative in that
distant colony was subjected, it may be sufficient to
state that, in consequence of the imprisonment of Mr.
Macarthur, an old officer, and a rich and influential
settler, great disturbance was excited, which ended in
the seizure of the governor&#8217;s person, and in the occupation
of his office and authority by Major Johnston, the
commanding officer of the New South Wales Corps,
who assumed the authority of lieutenant-governor in
January, 1808, and issued some proclamations ordering
various changes among those in authority. In one of
these proclamations a day of thanksgiving is appointed
to be kept for the recent transactions; and in the same
precious document the Rev. Henry Fulton is suspended
from discharging his duty as chaplain to the colony,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
because, whatever may have been the faults of his former
life,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> like most other clergymen of the Church of England,
on most other occasions, he had at this time stood
fast to his loyalty.</p>

<p>The confusion resulting from the seizure of the
governor was lamentable indeed in a colony at the best
of times so difficult to be managed. All public meetings
were forbidden by the party in power, and our old
friends, the Presbyterians at Portland Head, whose
loyalty to the governor on this occasion was very
creditable, had well nigh got into trouble from their
meeting together on &ldquo;the Sabbath&rdquo; for public worship.
The object of the intruders was to get rid of Captain
Bligh as well as they could, and accordingly he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
sent off to England in command of the <em>Porpoise</em>, but he
remained from March to December, 1809, off the coast
of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, daily expecting despatches from
the home government, until at last, on December 28th,
his intended successor, Colonel Macquarie, arrived at
Sydney. This last gentleman was ordered to reinstate
Captain Bligh in the government of the colony for the
period of twenty-four hours after his own arrival; but in
consequence of Bligh&#8217;s absence from Sydney, this was
not done. However, Major Johnston was sent home
under strict arrest, and, after various delays, he was
tried for mutiny, by a court-martial, in May 1811, and
found guilty, but was only sentenced to be cashiered,
the court considering the peculiar circumstances of the
case sufficient to excuse him from a more severe
punishment. Captain Bligh was, upon his return to England,
immediately promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and
employed in active service; while the New South Wales
Corps, which had certainly been long enough in the
colony from which it drew its name, was ordered home,
and the 73d regiment sent out to supply its place.</p>

<p>The first acts of the new governor, Colonel Macquarie,
were to declare the king&#8217;s displeasure at the late
mutinous proceedings, and to render null and void all the
acts of the usurping party, most of whose measures were,
however, ratified, their bills upon the Treasury honoured,
and their grants of land confirmed. The continuance of
Governor Macquarie in power for no less than twelve
years, during which peace and tranquillity, undisturbed
by any very severe trials, prevailed throughout the settlement,
offers but very few of those events which make a
figure in the history of the past:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Famine and plague, the earthquake and the storm,</span><br />
 Man&#8217;s angry passions, war&#8217;s terrific form,<br />
 The tyrant&#8217;s threatenings, and the people&#8217;s rage,<br />
 These are the crowded woes of History&#8217;s page.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
During the period of which we are now treating, vast
improvements and extensive discoveries were made in
New South Wales; and in all these, or similar, arts of
peace the governor delighted to bear an active and
leading part. Availing himself of the means at his disposal,
and of the abundance of convict-labour, he made,
it is said, no less than 276 miles of good roads during
his administration; and, when the nature of the country
along which many of these were carried is taken into
account, this exploit alone reflects no small credit upon
Governor Macquarie. In the year 1813 the colony was
enabled, by the courage and perseverance of three gentlemen,
to burst those bonds by which it had hitherto
been hemmed in within the limits of a narrow strip of
land running along the sea-coast. In that year a passage
across the Blue Mountains, hitherto thought insuperable,
was at length made good; and the hungry sheep and
cattle which had been suffering from the prevailing
drought in the settlement, were speedily driven over the
hills to enjoy the less withered pastures and green plains
of the western country. No sooner was this district thus
opened than the governor commenced making a road
over the mountains, and in this he succeeded after no
very long delay, so that a good communication was
formed between Sydney and Bathurst Plains, a distance
of more than 100 miles, about 50 of which cross an
extent of country the most rugged, mountainous, and
barren, that can be imagined.</p>

<p>In public buildings Governor Macquarie showed
no less activity than in road-making, although his
efforts in the former line have not met with unmingled
and universal approbation. Certainly, the means
by which, what was then called, &ldquo;the Rum Hospital&rdquo;
was built were, if they are correctly reported by Dr.
Lang, disgraceful and mischievous in the highest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
degree.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> However, the improvements that were made
in the rising towns, especially in the capital, of the colony,
may well demand our admiration, even though, as usual
in estimating the deeds of fallen man, we must allow
that much evil might have been avoided, and that a
large proportion of moral mischief was mingled with
the improvements.</p>

<p>The great and distinguishing feature, after all, of
Colonel Macquarie&#8217;s government appears to have been
the studious, and not always judicious, patronage
extended by him to the emancipated convicts, whom he
generally considered in preference to the free settlers.
In consequence of this, the last-named class were thrown
into the background, a kind of check was given to
emigration, and, what was worst of all, two parties were
set on foot within the settlement, altogether opposed to
each other;&mdash;the <em>exclusionists</em>, who were free settlers,
refused to associate at all with those that had ever been
convicts; and the <em>emancipists</em> considered that a convict,
after his time of punishment had expired, was just as
good as any other man. It was absurd, indeed, although
no more than usually happens, to see men of the <em>humblest</em>,
if not of the <em>lowest</em>, classes in the mother country,
suddenly aspiring to become <em>exclusive</em> and <em>grand</em> in the
colony. And, on the other hand, it was a pretty sure
sign that the convicts, though emancipated from their
shackles, were not well rid of their vice or impudence,
when they laid claim, even with the aid of a governor&#8217;s
encouragement, and often of great wealth not very
scrupulously acquired, to the highest society and most
important offices in the settlement. Undoubtedly, one
great object in a penal colony should be that of gradually
purifying the population from all disgraceful or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
vicious associations; but the hasty attempts of a
governor to elevate a class like that of the emancipated
convicts were sure to end rather in their depression.
Time, and a succeeding generation, would have done
quietly what Colonel Macquarie, with all his power, was
unable to accomplish. If a governor cannot make pickpockets
become good <em>farmers</em>, still less likely is he to
succeed in endeavouring to make good <em>magistrates</em> of
them; but a few years, under judicious management,
might easily produce from among their children admirable
specimens of both. And nothing can be a greater
hindrance to this desirable result than hasty and ill-timed,
though well-intended, attempts to force out of
their proper sphere those persons, who, if they are
really possessed of any sense, would, of all men, desire
to keep within it.</p>

<p>In reckoning up the principal occurrences during the
twelve years in which Colonel Macquarie ruled the
colony, the vast additions which were made to our
knowledge of the country are by no means to be
overlooked. Bathurst Plains and the pass to them through
the Blue Mountains were, as we have already seen,
discovered; the district of Argyle to the south-westward
was also made known. Two rivers, named after the
governor, who was (it is reported) fond of such
compliments, the Lachlan and the Macquarie, were traced
westward of the Blue Mountains, until they were supposed
to lose themselves in endless and impassable
swamps. Northwards, the River Hastings, and a large
extent of country suitable for flocks and herds, called
Liverpool Plains, were discovered. Besides which,
three penal settlements for the punishment of unruly
convicts were formed, one at Emu Plains, another at
Newcastle, near the mouth of the River Hunter, and a
third at Port Macquarie, at the mouth of the Hastings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
But the mention of new penal settlements, in which
the punishment and removal of gross offenders were the
only objects, while the reformation and salvation of
those poor men were never thought of, forcibly recalls us
to a subject of which we have for some time lost sight,
and which must be once more noticed before the history
of the rise and early progress of the colony of New
South Wales is completed. Where was the Church all
this time? What was the Church of England doing in
the now flourishing settlement of Australia? How far
did the state follow at once both its duty and its interest,
and employ in the work of reformation in this
land of criminals those heavenly instruments, the Bible
and the Church? The reply to all these inquiries is
briefly made, but the national sin and shame involved in
that short reply it might need volumes to unfold.</p>

<p>In 1821, at the end of Macquarie&#8217;s government, there
was scattered about in the colony a population of
29,783, of whom 13,814 were convicts, and among these
were found ministering <em>seven</em> clergymen of the
Church of England, with no bishop of that Church to
&ldquo;set things in order&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> nearer than the Antipodes,&mdash;the
very opposite side of the habitable globe! Nor, if we look
(as unhappily now in every English colony we must
look,) beyond the pale of the English Church, shall we
find either Romish superstition or Dissenting zeal working
any of their usual wonders. Though the number of
Romanists from Ireland was very great in the colony,
yet they had, in 1821, only <em>one</em> priest residing among
them; the Presbyterians at Portland Head had a catechist
only, and with respect to the other &ldquo;denominations&rdquo;
little or nothing is recorded:&mdash;the <em>establishment</em>
had taken as yet so poor a hold of the soil of New South
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Wales, that the <em>voluntary system</em>, which seems often to
need its support, as ivy needs the support of a tree, had
scarcely been transplanted thither. One observation,
before we quit for the present this painful subject,
forces itself upon the mind. How utterly unlike are the
ways of an All-Perfect God from the ways of imperfect
fallen men! The King of kings desireth not the death
of any sinner, and has wrought miracles upon miracles
of mercy to provide for his salvation; whereas man regardeth
not the spiritual life of his brethren, earthly
monarchs and nations care chiefly about the removal of
the offenders out of their sight, and, so long as this is
effected, they trouble not themselves about the future
lot of those outcasts; money is more willingly parted
with for &ldquo;penal settlements&rdquo; than for religious instruction,
and, although the earthly wants of the criminals are
attended to, here humanity stops short;&mdash;if their <em>bodies</em>
are not cast out to starve and to perish <em>their souls are</em>.
And who cannot read in holy Scripture the just doom of
those that have acted, or are acting, thus? &ldquo;The
wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will
I require at thine hand.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Having now brought down the history of the colony
of New South Wales to a period when it might be said
to be firmly established and flourishing, both party
feeling and needless details may best be avoided by
stopping here, yet it will not form an unsuitable conclusion
to this chapter to borrow General Macquarie&#8217;s
account of his own doings, although this may be somewhat
tinctured with that vanity, which is said to have
been his greatest weakness:&mdash;&ldquo;I found the colony,&rdquo; he
states, in a Report to Earl Bathurst, &ldquo;barely emerging
from infantile imbecility, and suffering from various privations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and disabilities; the country impenetrable beyond
40 miles from Sydney; agriculture in a yet languishing
state; commerce in its early dawn; revenue unknown;
threatened with famine; distracted by faction; the public
buildings in a state of dilapidation, and mouldering
to decay; the few roads and bridges formerly constructed
rendered almost impassable; the population in
general depressed by poverty; no public credit nor
private confidence; the morals of the great mass of the
population in the lowest state of debasement, and religious
worship almost totally neglected.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Such was the
state of New South Wales when I took charge of its
administration on the 1st of January, 1810. I left it in
February last, reaping incalculable advantages from my
extensive and important discoveries in all directions,
including the supposed insurmountable barrier called
the Blue Mountains, to the westward of which are situated
the fertile plains of Bathurst; and <em>in all respects</em> [?]
enjoying a state of private comfort and public prosperity,
which I trust will at least equal the expectations
of His Majesty&#8217;s Government. On my taking the command
of the colony in the year 1810, the amount of
port duties collected did not exceed 8000<em>l.</em> per annum,
and there were only 50<em>l.</em> or 60<em>l.</em> of a balance in the
Treasurer&#8217;s hands; but now (in 1822,) duties are collected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
at Port Jackson to the amount of from 28,000<em>l.</em> to
30,000<em>l.</em> per annum. In addition to this annual colonial
revenue, there are port duties, collected at Hobart
Town and George Town in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, to the
amount of between 8000<em>l.</em> and 10,000<em>l.</em> per annum.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE COLONY OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</strong></p>


<p>The next objects that demand our notice in Australia
are the British colonies, and their present inhabitants.
We have already given our attention to the Bush and its
wild inhabitants, and the lengthened yet rapid process
by which a lonely bay was converted, within the space
of little more than forty years, into the flourishing capital
of a rising country, has been fully traced. It now
remains for the reader to be made acquainted with the
natural features, civil divisions, and present state of the
British Australian colonies,&mdash;especially of the oldest
and most important of them, called New South Wales.
Were we not already informed of the sad reality of
things, we might be tempted to indulge in the daydreams
of an explorer, and to join in the bright and
hopeful visions of a most pleasing writer, respecting the
blessings to arise out of a change of any district from
wild bush to civilized colony. But dreams of this
nature are little better than vanity, and so our explorer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
himself tells us at the end of his narrative:&mdash;&ldquo;Whilst I
stretched my weary length,&rdquo; says Captain Grey, &ldquo;along,
under the pleasant shade, I saw in fancy busy crowds
throng the scenes I was then amongst. I pictured to
myself the bleating sheep and lowing herds wandering
over these fertile hills; and I chose the very spot on
which my house should stand, surrounded with as fine
an amphitheatre of verdant land as the eye of man had
ever gazed on. The view was backed by the Victoria
Range, whilst seaward you looked out through a romantic
glen upon the great Indian ocean. I knew that within
four or five years civilization would have followed my
tracks, and that rude nature and the savage would no
longer reign supreme over so fine a territory. Mr.
Smith entered eagerly into my thoughts and views;
together we built these castles in the air, trusting we
should see happy results spring from our present sufferings
and labours,&mdash;but within a few weeks from this
day he died in the wilds he was exploring.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> So little
are the brilliant hopes inspired by discovery to be
depended upon, nor less uncertain are the expectations
which the colonization of a district awakens in our
hearts. We cannot but look for good results, yet frequently
are we doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>However, the assurance of the superintendence of
Divine Providence may check all misgivings; and under
this wholesome persuasion we may proceed to consider
the present condition of that country, which has been
recently settled and civilized on the eastern coast of
New Holland, and which is known by the name of New
South Wales. It is manifestly impossible, in describing
a territory like this, continually increasing and enlarging
itself, whilst at the same time much of the country
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
already within its bounds is barren and almost unknown,
to maintain that accuracy which we are accustomed to
find in descriptions of the counties or districts of our
own well-defined and cultivated island. Yet, in New
South Wales, as in Great Britain, the territory is divided
into counties, and occasionally into parishes; and it
may serve to give the reader a general idea of the
whole country, if each of these former divisions is briefly
noticed.</p>

<p>The county called Cumberland is the most populous
and important, although by no means the most fertile,
in the whole province. It contains the capital, Sydney,
and the thriving towns of Paramatta, Liverpool, Windsor,
Richmond, &amp;c.; so that in population it far exceeds all
the others. It is described as an undulating plain,
extending from north to south about fifty-three miles,
and in breadth from the sea to the base of the Blue
Mountains, upwards of forty miles. The coast is generally
bold and rocky, and to the distance of a few miles
inland the soil is a poor sandstone, and the country
looks bleak and barren; further from the sea its
appearance improves, an undulating country extends
itself to the width of about ten miles, and this district,
where it has been left in its natural state, has the
appearance of a noble forest, but, although partially cultivated,
the soil still continues poor, for it rests upon a
foundation of sandstone. Beyond this, the soil becomes
better, the trees are less numerous, the herbage more
luxuriant, the scenery beautifully varied, the hills are
generally more fertile than the valleys, and the farms
and cultivated spots are very numerous. In the valleys
of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers, the richness of
the soil is very great, and the plains are extensive. One
great evil, the scarcity of good water, has been very
much felt in this country, but it is expected that by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
boring, the deficiency may be supplied. The coast of
Cumberland is broken and indented by many creeks or
inlets, the most remarkable of which is the noble harbour
of Port Jackson. The county of Cumberland is said to
contain about 900,000 acres, of which not more than
one-third is fit for cultivation, and all the good land in it
has been long since granted away. Unfortunately, that
part of the country which is most fertile and preferable,
is the very part where scarcely any natural springs are
to be found, for, although these are abundant on the
coast, and in the sandstone country, beyond that line
they are rarely met with; and, since the tides flow to a
considerable distance up all the rivers, the water of
these is in many parts of the district brackish and unfit
for use; besides which, in the summer-time, the smaller
streams become dry, or dwindle down into mere chains
of ponds, barely sufficient to supply the wants of the
cattle.</p>

<p>The next county to the southward of Cumberland is
named Camden, which continues the line of coast, extending
itself about sixty-six miles in length, and being
in breadth, towards the interior, about fifty-five miles.
This is a more mountainous district than Cumberland,
and abounds in lofty timber, but, nevertheless, there are
several large tracts of great fertility contained within its
limits. The district called Illawarra, or the Five Islands,
and that of the Cow Pastures, are the most remarkable;
and being both of them rural districts, they may be briefly
described here. Illawarra is a very peculiar spot: it is
situated immediately between the sea and a range of high
hills, so steep that they are almost impassable, while on
the remaining side, upon which neither of these two
boundaries enclose it, Illawarra is bounded by the Shoal
Haven River. The district thus separated by nature
from the adjoining country, extends about eighteen miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
along the coast, and is said to comprise 150,000 acres of
most beautiful scenery and very fertile soil. The greater
part of Illawarra is heavily timbered, and it is said to
be not well fitted for the rearing of sheep; but for the
plough its deep vegetable soil is admirably suited, and
whenever the land begins to feel the effect of repeated
cropping, there are means of enriching it at hand in the
large heaps of decayed shells to be found upon the sea-shore,
which would furnish an excellent manure. The
communication between this fertile spot, and the nearest
market of any consequence, Sydney, is carried on almost
entirely by water; and the Shoal Haven River being navigable
for vessels of eighty or ninety tons to the distance
of twenty miles up the country, affords the ready means
of conveying produce to the capital from many parts of
Illawarra. Besides this navigable river, the southern
boundary of the district, there are many smaller streams
which issue from the mountains to the north and west,
so that the country is well watered, besides which
advantage it is said to have a larger share of rain than
many other parts of the colony, and to be sheltered from
the blighting winds which occasionally have proved
destructive to the crops elsewhere. The mountain range by
which Illawarra is shut in, partakes of the general fertility
of the neighbourhood below, and it is supposed, from its
eastern aspect, and mild climate, to offer spots favourable
for the cultivation of the vine. The timber of the
district is very profitable, when felled, and highly
ornamental where it is left standing. Indeed, the immense
fern-trees, shooting up their rough stems, like large oars,
to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and then suddenly
putting forth leaves in every direction, four or five feet
in length, and exactly like the leaf of the common fern,&mdash;the
different kinds of palms rising to the height of
seventy or one hundred feet, and then forming large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
canopies of leaves; the cedars, the undergrowth of wild
vines, creeping plants and shrubs, in rich abundance;
all combine to remind the visitor of a tropical climate,
of a more <em>northern</em>, or as Englishmen would naturally
say, more <em>southern</em>, climate than that of Illawarra.</p>

<p>Respecting the Cow Pastures, the rural district, which,
next to Illawarra, is most deserving of notice in the
county of Camden, little further need be added to what
has been already stated in another place. Instead of
<em>cow pastures</em>, however, nearly the whole of the 60,000
acres of good land, which form this district, have now
become <em>sheep farms</em>; and the soil appears to be very
suitable to the growth and perfection of the last-named
animal. Towards the southern and eastern parts of the
cow pastures are numerous streams, which retain water
even in dry weather, and which communicate with the
Nepean River. There do not appear to be any towns
deserving of mention in the county of Camden, and its
population is small and rural: it is crossed in every
direction by steep ridges of hills, which almost always
tower upwards like the roof of a house, and where the
country is mountainous, meet so close as to leave only
a narrow ravine betwixt them.</p>

<p>The adjoining county, which may be next noticed, is
that of Argyle, an inland district, not having any front
whatever towards the ocean, and lying to the south-westward
of the county last described. Argyle is about
sixty miles in length, with an average breadth of thirty
miles; it is a lofty and broken region, and abounds in
small rivulets and ponds, containing water during the
whole of the year. It is also well furnished with timber,
although there are places where the trees are scattered
sparingly, and likewise plains of considerable extent,
entirely bare of trees. Of this description are Goulburn&#8217;s
Plains, which consist of open downs, affording
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
good pasturage for sheep, and extending twenty miles
southward from the township to which they owe their
name, their breadth being about ten. There are some
remarkable lakes in this county, or near its borders, the
two largest of which are called Lake George and Lake
Bathurst. Some of the old natives say that they can
remember when these lakes did not exist; and dead
trees are found in the bed of Lake George, the whole of
which was, in October 1836, dried up, and like a grassy
meadow.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Bathurst is another inland county, lying nearly due
west of Cumberland, but not adjoining it, which may
deserve to be briefly described. In looking over a map
of the colony of New South Wales, it appears strange
that counties, like this, comparatively remote both from
the capital and from the sea, should be more known and
flourishing than others lying betwixt them and these
important objects. But when we reflect upon the nature
of the country, and remember that the intervening
counties are in a great measure occupied by the Blue
Mountains, with their tremendous ravines and dreary
sandstone wastes, all wonder will cease at finding the
green pastures and smiling country beyond the mountains
occupied, while the rugged tract is suffered to
remain for the most part in its natural state, and instead
of becoming populous itself, is employed only as a
channel of communication between the consuming population
on the coast and the producing population of the
more fertile interior. Bathurst is in length seventy-two
miles, and in breadth sixty-eight, in shape somewhat
approaching to an irregular square. No part of this
district was explored before 1813. It is, in general, a
kind of broken table-land, in some places forming extensive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and bare downs, as, for instance, Bathurst Plains,
containing 50,000 acres. Occasional open downs of this
kind, and not unlike the South Downs in England,
extend along the banks of the Macquarie for upwards of
one hundred miles. Bathurst is reckoned one of the
most flourishing and desirable situations in the whole
colony, and the view of these plains from the high land
to the eastward upon the road from Sydney is very
interesting. The prospect of an extensive district naturally
destitute of timber is rare in Australia, and therefore
it surprises and pleases the eye of the traveller.
Bathurst Plains form, however, by no means a dead
level, but consist rather of a series of gentle elevations,
with intervening flats of moderate extent; the surrounding
forest is rather thin, and patches of it extend irregularly
to some distance in the plains, like points of land
projecting into a lake.</p>

<p>The green pastures and naturally clear state of this
district, formed the first inducements to settlers to
occupy a spot, which is now distant from Sydney by
the road 121 miles, about fifty of which cross the
wildest and most barren mountains imaginable, and
which then had no road at all leading to it, except a
difficult mountain-pass only recently discovered; consequently,
the district was portioned out chiefly in large
grants to persons whose means enabled them to cope
with the difficulties of approaching the new settlement;
and the society at Bathurst Plains is esteemed very
good; possibly it may be all the better for its distance
from the capital. But the best proof of the goodness
of the society in this neighbourhood is the attention
which the inhabitants are stated to pay to their religious
duties, and the harmony in which they live with one
another.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The situation of Bathurst Plains is an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
exceedingly high one, being more than 2000 feet above
the level of the sea; and this elevation, rendering the
climate much cooler,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> produces the same vegetable productions
in the parallel latitude of Sydney with those
that are to be found in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, ten degrees
farther to the south. Bathurst is said to be a very
healthy climate; wonders are told of the climate of
New South Wales generally, and yet we are informed
that &ldquo;the cheeks of the children beyond the mountains
have a rosy tint, which is seldom observable in the
lowlands of the colony.&rdquo; However, notwithstanding
all that may be said, disease and death can find out
their victims even in Bathurst Plains.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Guilt&#8217;s fatal doom in vain would mortals fly,</span><br />
 And they that breathe the purest air must die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The county of Northumberland is one of the most
important and valuable in the colony; it is upon the
sea-coast, and adjoins Cumberland, being bounded on
the south by the river Hawkesbury, and on the north
by the Hunter. Its length is about 60 miles, and its
breadth about 50: whilst its general appearance is
undulating, with high table lands dispersed among the
hills, and it is well watered by many streams and rivulets.
Within this county are two great sources of
worldly wealth,&mdash;the coal-mines near one of its principal
towns, Newcastle, and the rich productive farms in the
valley of the Hunter. The last-named river is navigable
for small craft for fifty miles above Newcastle, which is
a thriving little port, and boats may ascend two of its
three principal branches for about 120 and 200 miles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
but the navigation is liable to be interrupted by sudden
and tremendous floods.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Coal is to be found in several parts of New South
Wales, but it is most abundant in the country to the south
of Hunter&#8217;s River, which forms part of the county of
Northumberland. Even at some distance from the shore,
the black lines of coal may be seen in the cliffs upon the
coast, and the coal-pits in this neighbourhood are worked
with comparatively little trouble. The Australian
Agricultural Company have obtained a grant of these from
government: and, as a specimen of the demand for coals
some years ago, it may be stated, that, in 1836, there
were sold at the pit&#8217;s mouth 12,646 tons for 5,747<em>l.</em>, being
at about the rate of nine shillings per ton. Since that
time the consumption has been very rapidly increasing,
and steam navigation has now become common in the
colony;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> so that, besides the manufactories of Sydney,
and the supply of private families, there is an additional
demand for fuel created by the steam-boats plying constantly
along that remote coast, which only a century
ago no European had yet beheld. It is also reported
that iron is to be found in New South Wales, at no great
distance from the coal which is so necessary to smelt it;
and, if this be true, with these two principal causes of
the wealth of the mother country concealed within its
bosom, it is quite possible that, in the course of time, the
colony may rival, or outstrip, England itself in worldly
prosperity.</p>

<p>But, however valuable these elements may be, the
riches of a country are based upon more important
pursuits than mining or manufactures, and in those
fundamental sources of wealth,&mdash;in agriculture and its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
kindred occupations,&mdash;the county of Northumberland
stands foremost in New South Wales. Not even the
rich valleys of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers can
excel in fruitfulness or in cultivation that of Hunter&#8217;s
River. Wheat and maize are among the chief productions
of this fine agricultural district, of which Maitland
is the principal town. Potatoes, tobacco, cheese, and
butter are also forwarded to Sydney for sale from this
highly favoured spot. Were it not for the fearful floods
to which, in common with many other rivers in the
colony, Hunter&#8217;s River is liable, altogether this valley,
and the <em>arms</em>, or branch valleys, which lead into it,
might well be esteemed among the finest situations in the
world; and now that this liability is well known, and
may be provided against, the objections arising on this
score are greatly diminished. Still, a flood rising
suddenly forty or sixty feet, and pouring with headlong
fury down the peaceful cultivated valleys, is a just object
of dread, and a tremendous visitation.</p>

<p>We cannot leave the subject of this rich and beautiful
district, abounding in inhabitants and rural wealth,
without borrowing the words of the Bishop of Australia
in describing its recent increase in those means of grace
and hopes of glory, which are, after all, the only true
riches. In 1833, when this neighbourhood was visited,
&ldquo;there was but one clergyman in the entire tract of
country, extending from the mouth of the Hunter to its
source, and the great and growing population on its
banks would have appeared, (if we could have forgotten
the ability of God to raise up children to himself, and to
provide them with spiritual food even from the stones of
the desert,) to be abandoned to inevitable destitution,
both they and their children. But it has pleased the
Almighty to cause the prospect to brighten, and now
(in 1839) there will be seven clergymen dispensing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
pure ordinances and inculcating the salutary principles
of the Church.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>It would be at once wasting time and presuming upon
the reader&#8217;s patience to attempt to describe particularly
the remaining counties of New South Wales, which are
yet but imperfectly known and partially colonized. It
will be sufficient to notice the names of the others, which,
together with those described above, amount to nineteen
in number. Besides Cumberland, Camden, Argyle,
Bathurst, and Northumberland, the counties of Cook,
Westmoreland, Roxburgh, Wellington, Phillip, Bligh,
Brisbane, Hunter, Gloucester, Georgiana, King&#8217;s County,
Murray, Durham, and St. Vincent&#8217;s, may deserve to be
mentioned by name, but nothing especially worthy of
notice suggests itself respecting them. We may turn,
therefore, from the rural districts, and take a rapid view
of the principal towns of New South Wales. Among
these the capital, Sydney, claims the first place, not less
as a matter of right than of courtesy. By a happy concurrence
of events, the very first settlement made upon
the eastern coast of New Holland was formed upon one
of its most eligible spots; and accordingly that town,
which ranks first in point of time, is likely always to
rank first in population, in size, in commerce, and in
wealth. The harbour alone would offer advantages
enough to secure considerable importance to a town
erected upon its shores, and before Sydney itself is more
minutely described, we may borrow the account of Port
Jackson, which has been given by one well acquainted
with its scenery, and himself by birth an Australian.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
It is navigable for fifteen miles from its entrance, that is,
seven miles beyond Sydney; and in every part there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
good anchorage and complete shelter from all winds.
Its entrance is three quarters of a mile in width, and
afterwards expands into a spacious basin, fifteen miles
long, and in some places three broad, with depth of
water sufficient for vessels of the largest size. The
harbour is said to have 100 coves, and there is room
within it for all the shipping in the world. The views
from its shores are varied and beautiful. Looking
towards the sea, the eye catches at a single glance the
numerous bays and islets between the town and the
headlands at the entrance of the harbour, while the bold
hills by which it is bounded end abruptly on the coast.
To the north a long chain of lofty rugged cliffs mark the
bearing of the shore in that direction, and turning southwards,
the spectator beholds, seven or eight miles
distant, the spacious harbour of Botany Bay, beyond
which a high bluff range of hills extends along to the
south in the direction towards Illawarra. Westward one
vast forest is to be seen, varied only by occasional
openings which cultivation and the axe have made on
the tops of some of the highest hills. Beyond the
numberless undulations of this wooded country the Blue
Mountains are espied, towering behind the whole background
of the scene, and forming a stately boundary to
the prospect. This description of the scenery of Port
Jackson applies to a particular spot very near to Sydney,
but the views are similar in general character, though
infinitely varied in detail, at other places in the
neighbourhood; and nearer to the entrance of the harbour a
new and still grander object breaks upon the sight:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Where the mighty Pacific with soft-swelling waves</span><br />
 A thousand bright regions eternally laves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this beautiful and convenient piece of water,
which has been just described, is the capital of the principal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
British colony in Australia situated. It is chiefly
built upon two hilly necks of land, enclosing between
them a small inlet, named Sydney Cove. The western
of these two projections divides Sydney Cove from
another called Cockle Bay, in both of which the water is
deep enough to allow the approach of the largest ships
to the very sides of the rocks. On this western neck,
(which is occupied with houses down to the water&#8217;s edge,
besides many others which extend into the country
behind,) the town forms a little peninsula, being surrounded
with water everywhere, except where it adjoins
the mainland. On the eastern neck of land the increase
of the town has been stopped by the government-house,
and its adjoining domains, which occupy the whole of
what is called Bennillong&#8217;s Point. With the exception
of the portion of the shore thus enclosed, the water-side
is occupied by wharfs, warehouses, ship-yards, mills, and
all the other buildings which mark a naval and commercial
town. Behind these marts of industry and wealth,
the houses rise one above the other, and, by their situation
on the slope of the hill, force themselves conspicuously
into notice. Indeed, the town covers a considerable
extent of ground, although land for building is so
valuable, that the intervening spaces, formerly used as
gardens and pleasure-grounds, will soon disappear and
be covered with houses. The public buildings of Sydney
are said to be neither numerous nor elegant, and certainly
no great beauty of architecture can be reasonably
expected in a town so recently built, and under such
circumstances, as Sydney. Nevertheless many of the
buildings are very large; and Mr. Wentworth says something
(though not much) in their favour, when he states
that they would not disgrace the great metropolis of
England itself. In one melancholy feature, Sydney too
nearly resembles London, namely, in the immense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
number of its public houses, of which, according to
Mr. Montgomery Martin, there were about two hundred
in the whole town. The population in 1841 was 29,973
souls. Of these, 16,505 were returned as belonging to
the Church of England; 8,126 to the Romish Church,
while the rest were returned as Presbyterians, Dissenters,
Jews, Mahometans, and Pagans. Sydney is divided into
four parishes: St. Philip, St. James, St. Andrew, and
St. Lawrence; in the two first of which churches have
long existed, and in St. James&#8217;s church the cathedral
service is daily used, with weekly communion; and there
is a choir, organ, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In the two last named parishes
no churches have existed until very recently, but through
the indefatigable exertions of Bishop Broughton, which
have been not unworthily seconded by the Rev. W.
Horatio Walsh, and the Rev. W. West Simpson, congregations
have been assembled together, which will, it may
be hoped, continue to attend the divine service of the
Church of England, long after more suitable buildings
than those originally used,&mdash;<em>a brewhouse and a
threshing-floor</em>,&mdash;shall have been provided for their
accommodation. In St. Lawrence&#8217;s parish a regular church was
begun in 1840, and is probably completed before this time; and,
to the credit of Sydney, it may be stated, that no less
than 571<em>l.</em> were collected from those present at the meeting
in which the erection of the church was resolved upon.
In St. Andrew&#8217;s it is proposed to raise the cathedral
church of the diocese of Australia; and, therefore, it
must necessarily be longer before the building can be
completed; but the importance of this undertaking cannot
be more clearly shown than by the recent statement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of Bishop Broughton, whence it would appear that of
7000 inhabitants in St. Andrew&#8217;s parish, 3500 belong
to the Church of their fathers or of their native home&mdash;the
scriptural and apostolical Church of England. But
more of these, and similar matters elsewhere. It was
a wise and useful arrangement of our forefathers, by
which our parishes were made at once ecclesiastical and
civil divisions; and since this practice has in some measure
been followed out in our colonies, the reader will
excuse the brief observations thus suggested by the
mention of the civil division of Sydney into four parishes.
One more remark, and that a painful one, may be added.
The expenses of the police establishment, <em>in the town of
Sydney alone</em>, cost the government, in the year 1838, the
sum of 12,350<em>l.</em>, whereas the cost of the ecclesiastical
establishment of the Church of England, in the same
town, (including the stipend of the bishop,) amounted
only to 3,025<em>l.</em> during that year.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Supposing (what is
most likely) that the former sum is by no means <em>too
much</em>, how far <em>too little</em> must the latter be!</p>

<p>Sydney has a very good market, which is tolerably
well supplied with the necessaries of life; but many of
these, as for example, eggs, butter, apples, &amp;c., are very
dear at present, compared with the prices usual in the
mother country; while tea, coffee, sugar, &amp;c. are cheap
in proportion. The most expensive article of living in
Sydney is house-rent, which appears to be enormously
high, so that 100<em>l.</em> a year is considered only a moderate
charge for an unfurnished house, with ordinary conveniences;
and out of the salary allowed by government to
the Bishop of Australia, upwards of one-seventh part is
expended in rent alone. The shops in the capital of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
New South Wales are said to be very good, and the
articles well and tastefully arranged; but the social
condition of the colony naturally tends to make the
persons who keep them very different, and a much less
respectable class, speaking generally, than the
tradespeople of the mother country. The noble harbour of
Port Jackson, and the position of the capital of the
colony, unite in affording every possible encouragement
to trade; and the following account given by the Sydney
Herald, last year (1842) is about the most recent statement
that has been received of the present condition
of that commerce, which is altering and increasing every
year. The shipping of Sydney now amounts to 224
vessels of the aggregate burden of 25,000 tons, of which
15 are steamers, of an aggregate burden of 1635 tons.
This statement may give some idea of the rapidity with
which the ports of the Southern world are rising into an
almost European importance.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Since the year 1817
several large banks have been established, and, from
the high rate of interest which money has always borne
in the colony, it is not surprising that some of these
concerns have been very profitable. It is only to be
hoped that the spirit of speculation may not be carried
out, till it ends, as it too frequently does in the mother
country, in fraud and dishonesty.</p>

<p>There is a well-managed post-office in Sydney, and
a twopenny post, with delivery twice a day, in the town
itself. There is, likewise, a Savings&#8217; Bank,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> a Mechanics&#8217;
Institute, several large schools or colleges; and, in short,
so far as is possible, the usages and institutions of
England, whether good or bad, are, in most instances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
transferred and copied with amazing accuracy by the
inhabitants of New South Wales. &ldquo;Nothing surprises
a stranger in an English colony more than the pertinacity
with which our ways, manners, and dress are spread in
these outlandish spots. All smells of home.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Accordingly,
in complete agreement with the manners of the
mother country, though not in harmony with that Word
of Truth which commands Christians &ldquo;with one mind
and one mouth to glorify God,&rdquo; (Rom. xv. 6,) the capital
of New South Wales is adorned with several buildings
for various parties in the <em>Christian world</em>, as it is called,
to meet in public worship. There is a large and handsome
Roman Catholic chapel, &ldquo;a Scotch church, built
after the <em>neat and pleasing style</em> (?) adopted by the
disciples of John Knox; and the Methodist chapel, an humble
and lowly structure;&rdquo; and, therefore, according to Mr.
Montgomery Martin&#8217;s opinion, from whom this account
is borrowed, all the better fitted to lead men to admire,
love, and worship their Creator. How different are
these modern notions from those of King David, who,
although he was blessed with quite as exalted ideas of
God&#8217;s omnipresence as most men have, nevertheless
deemed it wrong for himself to &ldquo;dwell in a house of
cedar,&rdquo; while &ldquo;the ark of God dwelt within curtains,&rdquo;
even the costly and beautifully-wrought curtains of the
tabernacle. And among the imitations of the customs
and habits of home, the love of newspapers, and the
number of these published, deserve a passing notice.
The state of the public press in England, especially with
regard to its Sunday publications, is grievous and
lamentable enough to justify the assertion, that printing
is a bane as well as a blessing to our native country.
And as for those persons who are weak enough to talk
as though newspapers were the great or sole means of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
diffusing <em>truth</em> and <em>knowledge</em> among the people, they
are not less mistaken than others would be, who might
affirm that newspapers were the chief or only means of
spreading <em>lies</em> and <em>ignorance</em> among them. But if so
much evil is mingled with the good produced by the
public press in Great Britain, how must the case stand
with the same mighty agent of benefit or mischief in
a colony like that of New South Wales? To this question
let Dr. Lang,&mdash;himself a newspaper editor in Sydney
for many years, a man of what are called &ldquo;Liberal principles,&rdquo;
and a Presbyterian teacher,&mdash;furnish a reply.
His words are stronger than another person, a stranger
to the colony, would like to use, or could be justified in
using; and if exceptions against his authority be made
in certain quarters, care must be taken by them not to
quote that same authority too implicitly on other subjects.
Dr. Lang, in the following passage, speaks disparagingly
of one of the great idols of his party; their favourite toast
has always been, &ldquo;The Liberty of the Press; it is like the
air we breathe, if we have it not, we die,&rdquo;&mdash;although it
is true they have occasionally forgotten that other
parties want &ldquo;air to breathe,&rdquo; as much as themselves.
Bearing these things in mind, we may listen with a
smile to the character which Dr. Lang gives of the
colonial press in New South Wales:&mdash;&ldquo;It has, with only
few exceptions, been an instrument of evil instead of
good; while, in many instances, it has been a mere
receptacle and propagator of downright blackguardism.&rdquo;
Accordingly, it is reckoned, (too justly, we may fear,)
among the <em>sources of colonial demoralization</em> in the very
paragraph from which the above statement is borrowed.</p>

<p>The next town to be noticed is Paramatta, which is
situated in the same county with Sydney, and, indeed, is
only eighteen miles by water, and fifteen by land, from
the capital; a circumstance that will, most likely,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
prevent it from ever reaching that size and consequence
to which at a greater distance it might have attained.
Paramatta is built along a small fresh-water stream,
which falls into the harbour of Port Jackson, at the very
head of which the town is seated. For the last few miles
the harbour is navigable only for boats of twelve or
fifteen tons burthen. The town consists chiefly of one
long street, and being backed by a ridge of hills, it has
a pleasing appearance, especially from the Sydney road,
where it breaks suddenly upon the view. The population
of Paramatta is 10,052 souls, and the neighbouring
country is tolerably well cleared and inhabited. In this
place is the country residence of the governor, and here
also is the station of one of the three regiments upon
duty in the colony. Besides these distinctions, Paramatta
has been chosen to be the site of several establishments
of no small utility and interest in New South Wales.
On the banks of the river is the Female Orphan School,
where the little friendless daughters of the colony are
trained up to be members of Christ&#8217;s holy Catholic
Church, and servants of Him who is &ldquo;the Father of the
fatherless, and the God of the widow, even God in his
holy habitation.&rdquo; Here, likewise, is another establishment
of a very different character, but if less successful
in its results, not less beneficial in its intentions. The
Paramatta factory, or rather penitentiary, is known
throughout the settlement, and has been the object of
much abuse from portions of the colonial press. Its
objects are, first, to afford a home and place of refuge to
those female convicts that are not yet assigned to
masters, or are out of service; and, secondly, to provide
an asylum for those who have misconducted themselves,
and to give them leisure for reflection and repentance.
At Paramatta, likewise, is the noble institution called
the King&#8217;s School, which may, with judicious care, prove
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
an invaluable blessing to the rising generation of the
colony. There are also in this town barracks, and a
hospital; an old gaol, and a new one lately erected, and
intended to serve for the whole county of Cumberland,
with the exception of the town of Sydney. Besides
these public buildings, there is a Roman Catholic chapel
and a Wesleyan meeting-house; and two Presbyterian
congregations assemble themselves in Paramatta; nor in
this enumeration must the convent lately commenced by
a few &ldquo;Sisters of Charity&rdquo; be forgotten. The Romanists
are rather numerous in this town, and very active. In a
private letter received from the neighbourhood of Paramatta,
after stating the hold possessed by the English
Church upon the affections of the people, the writer observes,
&ldquo;from the pretensions of the dissenters I cannot
affect any the slightest uneasiness. Our danger is from
Rome. I know not what to anticipate in that quarter.
Their exertions here are gigantic, and really do them
credit.&rdquo; Why should not the efforts of our purer and more
Scriptural Church be equally strenuous? On the south
side of the river is St. John&#8217;s Church, which is quite
removed from the principal increase of the population,
that having taken place chiefly on the opposite bank.
The Rev. Samuel Marsden, who was chaplain in New
South Wales for more than forty years, bequeathed 200<em>l.</em>
and gave a piece of land to promote the erection of a
second church here; but for one reason or another, no
progress had been made towards this desirable end, and
in a letter dated January 1842, Bishop Broughton stated
his resolution to commence the good work, even with
the scanty resources at his disposal, hoping that the
sight of a building in progress would awaken the
liberality, and stir up the hearts of those that were able
to contribute.</p>

<p>Windsor is the next town in the colony of New South
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Wales, which appears to be deserving of a particular
notice. It is in the county of Cumberland, and stands
upon a hill rising about 100 feet above the level of the
Hawkesbury, upon the banks of which river it is built,
and is thus placed beyond the reach of its occasional
destructive floods. The town is situated on a point of
land lying between the Hawkesbury and a stream
called South Creek, running on the other side; and so
numerous are the windings of the former river, that
although not more than thirty-five miles in a straight
line from the sea, the distance by the Hawkesbury is
140 miles. The destructive propensity of the colonists
to root up and destroy all trees, whether in the way of
agriculture or not, would appear to have worked wonders
in this neighbourhood, for among other advantages
detailed in an advertisement of property to be sold
there, it is stated that fire-wood is so scarce, as to ensure
considerable profit from the sale of the wood on the
estate. Windsor is twenty miles from Paramatta, and
thirty-six from Sydney, and the country around it is
very rich and beautiful. In some places the cliffs that
overhang the Hawkesbury are not less than 600 feet
in height; and the picturesque scenery, the numerous
vessels and boats upon the stream, which is here navigable
for ships of more than 100 tons, the views of the
fertile country in the neighbourhood, with its abundant
crops of wheat and Indian corn, the boundary of
the western horizon, formed by the Blue Mountains, the
base of which is about twenty miles distant: all these
natural beauties combine to render Windsor a very
agreeable spot. Its population is about 2000, and it
has the usual public buildings, a gaol, barracks, hospital,
&amp;c.; there is also a church dedicated to St. Matthew,
which until lately was served together with the chapel
at Richmond, a little town about five miles distant, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the same clergyman. There are also Roman Catholic,
Presbyterian, and Wesleyan places of worship.</p>

<p>The town of Liverpool, situated, like those already
mentioned, in the county of Cumberland, still remains to
be noticed. It is about twenty miles from Sydney, and
is built upon the banks of George&#8217;s River, a small
navigable stream which empties itself into Botany Bay,
the bleak and unsheltered inlet upon which the proposed
colony under Captain Phillip was to have been settled.
Liverpool is centrally situated, but the soil around it is
poor, and the population not very large; but since it is
the intended seat of the proposed college, founded by
Mr. Moore, it will probably hereafter become a place of
some consequence. There is nothing particularly to be
remarked respecting the buildings of Liverpool at present,
with the exception of the Male Orphan Asylum, which
is a very good institution, the boys being not only
educated there, but likewise brought up to different
trades, and general habits of industry. The number of
the orphan children in this school in 1839, was 153.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the limits of the county of Cumberland there
are very few towns which are large enough to merit
particular attention, and of these the situations of the
two most important and conspicuous, namely Bathurst
and Newcastle, have already been mentioned. Instead,
therefore, of wearying the reader with an attempt
minutely to describe the small towns of New South
Wales, it will be better to proceed without delay to a
description of the other British colonies in Australia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TASMANIA, AND THE OTHER AUSTRALIAN SETTLEMENTS.</strong></p>


<p>Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, or Tasmania, the next important
colony, is, as we have before stated, a separate island of
considerable size, nearly all the eastern side of which is
now inhabited by the English. It was divided into two
counties only, which are called Cornwall and Buckinghamshire,
but these being inconveniently large, a fresh
division into eleven counties, all of them borrowing the
names of some in England or Wales, has since taken
place.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> But without concerning ourselves about these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
smaller divisions, which it would be impossible to
describe exactly and distinctly, it may suffice to state,
that the two chief towns in the island are at its opposite
extremities, Hobart Town being at the south, and Launceston
at the north, and both of these are sea-ports; so
that the colony seems naturally to divide itself into two
provinces, each of which has one of these towns for its
capital, but which are both, nevertheless, similar in
their appearance, character, and productions.</p>

<p>Van Diemen&#8217;s Land is a more mountainous, and yet,
it would seem, a more fruitful country than New South
Wales. It is, according to the testimony of all who have
visited it, a most beautiful and pleasing land; the
mountains are tolerably high, but do not run much in
ranges, and the views among them are continually broken
and cheered by delightful valleys and fertile plains.
Among these hills, limestone is very commonly discovered,
and is now in considerable use; it is supposed,
likewise, that coals, and iron ore, will be found abundantly
in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, but these resources of
the colony have not yet been much explored. In the
cultivated parts of the country the soil varies greatly;
in some places it is a rich black mould, in others, sand
or flint is mingled; but its general fertility is proved by
the excellent crops which, year after year, it produces.
The coast of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land abounds in bays and
fine harbours; nor is this island at all deficient in
rivers and streams, imparting life to the landscape, and
fruitfulness to the soil. The Derwent, upon the banks
of which stands Hobart Town, is a very fine river,
without rocks or sand banks, and always safely navigable
for ships of considerable size. Both sides of
this river abound in beautiful and romantic scenery,
and although the soil is less productive than in some
other parts of the colony, yet the neighbourhood of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the capital, and the advantage of water-carriage, combine
to make amends for this inferiority. The Tamar
falls into the sea in Bass&#8217;s Strait, quite on the opposite
side of the island to the mouth of the Derwent;
and as Hobart Town adorns the latter river, so
the Tamar is enlivened by the trade and commerce of
the port of Launceston. The navigation of this river
for large vessels is not easy, in consequence of a bar
and other hindrances. The Tamar is formed by the
union of two smaller streams, named the North Esk, and
South Esk, and at Launceston, the distance from the
sea is about forty miles. Towards its mouth, the land
adjoining this stream is barren and sandy, but within a
few miles this kind of soil is succeeded by rich level
marshes, and beautiful slopes of moderately wooded and
rich pasture country rising up behind these. The other
rivers of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land are either, like the Huon,
situated in the uncolonized parts, or, like the Shannon,
the Jordan, and the Clyde, inconsiderable streams, so as
not to merit a more particular description. Many of
the Tasmanian rivers take their rise in lakes, which
are usually found in high situations in the central
parts of the island, and abound with water-fowl.</p>

<p>Hobart Town, the capital of a very beautiful and
lovely island, may boast of a situation of suitable loveliness
and beauty. Behind it, on the west, stand some
gently rising hills, well wooded, beyond which towers
Mount Wellington, 4000 feet in height, and having its
summit, during more than half the year, covered with
snow, but yet seldom obscured with clouds, because of
the pureness and clearness of the air. On the other side
of the town, to the eastward, is to be seen the noble
Derwent, which here better deserves to be called an arm
of the sea than a river, extending with its winding banks,
forming beautiful bays and lakes, or projecting into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
picturesque points, whilst its waters are enlivened by
the boats and shipping of the adjacent port. The water
here is salt, and the bay on which Hobart Town stands
affords one of the best anchorages in the world for
vessels, in whatever number or of whatever burden
they may be. Indeed it is said that the Derwent surpasses
even Port Jackson, or at least it is doubtful
which of the two deserves a preference.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The capital of
Tasmania is built upon gently rising ground, and though
within the present century its site was mere bush-land,
it has now some good streets, with large and handsome
shops and houses. According to Mr. Montgomery Martin,
the average rental of these was 50<em>l.</em> each, but then
we must not lose sight of the high value which houses
bear in Australia. However, at that calculation, the
annual value of rent in Hobart Town in the year 1835,
when there were 1281 houses, would be 72,000<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The
public buildings are said to be, some of them, handsome
and commodious. Court-house, barracks, hospital,
orphan-schools, jails, and government house, rank among
the principal buildings of Hobart Town; and in many
respects it appears to resemble a provincial sea-port in
the mother country. It has some excellent inns, good
wharfs and warehouses, and public banks, besides a few
considerable manufacturing establishments. A small
stream runs nearly through the centre of the town,
which, besides turning some mills, affords at certain
seasons a good supply of water. But the town is chiefly
supplied by means of pipes, which convey water to
private houses and likewise to the public pumps, and
occasionally, it would appear, some scarcity of this
needful article prevails.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The church of St. David&#8217;s, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the capital of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, is a large building,
and so it ought to be, since it was until lately the only
church for a population (including the suburbs) of
13,000 souls.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Besides the church, sundry other buildings
rear up their heads, here as elsewhere; and if any
thing could justify separation and divisions among those
for whom their Divine Master prayed &ldquo;that they might
be one,&rdquo; if in any case it were &ldquo;lawful to do evil that
good may come,&rdquo; then dissent of every kind might find
its excuse in a place like Hobart Town, where so
many thousand souls, the majority of them in a very
unhealthy state, have been formerly left in the charge
of one pastor. But instead of praying the Lord of the
vineyard for more labourers, and endeavouring themselves
to furnish the means of supplying these, men have
rushed, self-sent, or sent only by others having no more
authority than themselves, into the field of pastoral
labour. And while we lament the confusion that has
ensued, while we rejoice in whatever good may have
resulted from unauthorized preachers, we members of
the Church of England are compelled by truth to acknowledge,
that, if other men have been led astray by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
their eagerness and ignorance, we have been not less
culpably misled by our slothfulness and apathy. Accordingly
the marks of our needless divisions are every
where manifest; and like the noxious weeds which sometimes
hang about the roots of a noble tree, so are these
transplanted together with our best institutions into our
colonies. In the chief town of Tasmania are to be
found separate places of worship for Roman Catholics,
Presbyterians, Wesleyans, and Independents.</p>

<p>With respect to Launceston, which continues still to
be the principal town on the northern side of Van Diemen&#8217;s
Land, there is not much to be related. It stands
at the junction of the North and South Esk, and consequently
at the head of the navigation of the Tamar,
which is formed by these two streams. The town is
pleasantly situated at the foot of a hill upon a small
plain of about 200 acres of land. There are a few good
houses in Launceston, but its improvement has not kept
pace with that of Hobart Town; nor is it ever likely to
increase very greatly, since a government establishment
has been formed at George Town, a place about
thirty miles lower down, and consequently much nearer
to Port Dalrymple at the entrance of the Tamar, and
more convenient in its access for large ships. George
Town is well situated for every purpose of trade, but for
agriculture it offers no advantages, the soil in the
neighbourhood being very poor, and accordingly most of the
settlers prefer remaining at Launceston. The population
of the latter place may be nearly 1000, but no return
of this has been met with apart from the population of
the district to which the town gives its name. Launceston
has a chaplain and a church, of which no particular
account is given. There is also a Presbyterian
teacher resident in the town. At Longford, near Launceston,
may be found an example of &ldquo;patient continuance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in well-doing,&rdquo; which deserves to be recorded for the
encouragement of others. About the year 1830 the
first clergyman stationed there, the Rev. R. P. Davis,
began with a congregation of five, which appeared for
some time stationary. A church had been built which
it was thought would never be filled; but in eight years
afterwards, the walls could not contain those who were
anxious to hear the word of God in them. The grain of
mustard-seed had literally grown into a spreading tree;
the congregation had multiplied a hundredfold, and a
large church was about to be built, to which the inhabitants
had contributed 1500<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Other small places might
be mentioned, as Elizabeth Town, Perth, Brighton, &amp;c.,
which are very pleasant and thriving little settlements;
and the penal settlements of Port Macquarie and on
Tasman&#8217;s Peninsula might be described. Port Arthur,
one of these, is on the last-named Peninsula, a sterile
spot of about 100,000 acres, surrounded by sea, except
where a narrow neck of land connects it with the main
island; and this isthmus is guarded, night and day, by
soldiers, and by a line of fierce dogs. Nothing particularly
deserving of further notice presents itself, and
therefore we may conclude our brief sketch of Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land, wishing it and all the other British
colonies in Australia a progress no less rapid in religion
and morals, than their recent progress in commerce,
agriculture, riches, and luxuries has been. What condition
of a country can be more truly deplorable than that
which in holy Scripture is so powerfully set forth, when
the boast, &ldquo;I am rich and increased with goods, and
have need of nothing,&rdquo; is heard proceeding from a land
which in the sight of God is &ldquo;wretched, and miserable,
and poor, and blind, and naked?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
The Australian colonies may be said to form a family
group of British origin; and although the two elder
sisters are undoubtedly the most advanced and interesting,
yet some of the younger branches of the same
family may justly deserve to be noticed. We may begin
with the very recent colony called Port Phillip, which
lies between New South Wales and Van Diemen&#8217;s Land,
and which, as we have already seen, had well nigh taken
the place of the latter country in the honours of early
colonization. The country in the neighbourhood of the
inlet named Port Phillip is in many parts exceedingly
rich and fine; the scenery is varied by hills, woods, and
water; and besides much excellent pasture and sheep
walks, there are thousands of acres ready for the plough,
and capable of growing any European grain. The situation
of the principal town here, called Melbourne, is on
the Yarra Yarra river, just where its stream flows over
a fall and mingles with the salt water from Port Phillip,
from the head of which bay Melbourne is distant about
six miles by the course of the river, but across the land
not more than one and a half. The vessels generally
lie at Hobson&#8217;s Bay, distant by land four or five miles,
by water ten or twelve. There is a bar at the entrance
of the river which prevents large ships from coming up
close to Melbourne. The town appears to be rapidly
increasing; the commerce of Port Phillip is yearly extending;
its central position, the goodness of much of
the surrounding soil, and the fact of its being less
encumbered than is usually the case with wood, all
these circumstances unite in rendering this outpost, as
we may term it, of New South Wales, an important and
interesting spot. Respecting its prospects of religious
improvement and pastoral care, it is gratifying to be able
to quote the following statement from a letter of the
Bishop of Australia, of whose unwieldy diocese Port
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Phillip forms a part. &ldquo;At Melbourne the zeal of the
inhabitants has led them to undertake the erection of a
church, the estimated cost of which is nearly 7000<em>l.</em>
Although the certain and rapid increase of the town be
such as will, at no distant period, call for a church of
that importance, I greatly fear that resources may be
wanting for its immediate erection.&rdquo; Meanwhile the
Bishop expresses his anxiety that temporary accommodation,
at the least, should be provided for the great
numbers collected at Melbourne, who are desirous of
attending the church. &ldquo;It is evident,&rdquo; continues he,
&ldquo;that within a short interval there will be in the colony
few stations, with the exception, perhaps, of Sydney
itself, which will demand more assiduous care and
attention on behalf of its spiritual interests, than the
town whose streets extend over a spot where, not more
than three years ago, the Yarra Yarra flowed through
an almost uninterrupted solitude.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The population of
Melbourne is stated in a recent periodical to be 4479,
while that of the whole settlement of Port Phillip is
11,758. By the same authority the numbers of the
members of the Church of England in this English
colony are said to be 6194; that of the Presbyterians,
2045; of the Wesleyan Methodists, 651; of other dissenters,
1353; of Roman Catholics, 1441; of Jews, 59;
Mahommedans and Pagans, 10. The mention of Jews,
who are to be met with in almost all these remote
colonies of the southern ocean, can scarcely fail to recall
to mind God&#8217;s threatenings to his chosen people (see
Deut. xxviii. 64). We shall conclude this notice of Port
Phillip with mentioning two important items in the estimates
of its expenditure for 1842:&mdash;Police and jails,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
17,526<em>l.</em> 8<em>s.</em>; clergy and schools, 5350<em>l.</em>;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and,
as a commentary upon these disproportionate estimates, which
are by no means peculiar to Port Phillip, the words of
Sir George Arthur may be added:&mdash;&ldquo;Penitentiaries,
treadwheels, flogging, chain-gangs, and penal settlements,&rdquo;
says the late governor of Tasmania, &ldquo;will all
prove ineffectual either to prevent or to punish crime,
<em>without religious and moral instruction</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next of the infant colonies of Great Britain in
New Holland, which offers itself to our attention, as the
eye ranges over the map of that huge island, is the very
recently formed settlement of Southern Australia. This
is situated upon the southern coast likewise, and consists
of a large block of country, the inland parts of
which have not yet been explored, forming three sides
of a square, with the fourth side broken and jagged by
the inclination and indentations of the coast, which are
here very considerable. The area of South Australia
thus marked out is supposed to be about 310,000 square
miles, containing upwards of 98,000,000 of acres; that is
to say, it is double the size of the three British kingdoms,
and not much less than that of France.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The mode of
colonizing this extensive tract of country is proposed to
be upon different principles from those elsewhere followed
in Australia. No transported convicts are ever to
be sent there. No free grants of land are to be made,
but land can become private property by purchase alone,
and the whole of the purchase-money is proposed to be
spent in the encouragement of emigration. The emigrants
to be conveyed by means of this fund, without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
expense to the colony, were to be of both sexes in equal
numbers, and the preference is to be given to young
married persons not having children. The prospect of
having a representative assembly was held out to the
colony, but the population was to exceed 50,000 before
it could be lawful for the Crown to grant this.</p>

<p>To attempt to state accurately what the soil and
capabilities of so vast an extent of country may be,
would evidently be to attempt an impossibility. Of that
small part of it which is already occupied, much is barren,
hilly land, especially upon the coast. Nevertheless, it
would appear that South Australia has, so far as we can
at present judge, its full proportion of good and available
soil, both for the purposes of farming and for
pasture.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The situation of that part of the colony,
where the principal settlements have been commenced,
is very well chosen, for it lies upon the Gulf of St.
Vincent, a very deep inlet of the sea, and is well backed
with a range of hills to the eastward, beyond which the
country yet unexplored extends to the banks of the
river Murray; so that, in fact, the Murray and the Gulf
of St. Vincent, form natural boundaries to those settlements
which are already begun, and within these limits
it is said that there are the means of supporting comfortably
from one hundred to two hundred thousand
inhabitants. This statement agrees with Captain Sturt&#8217;s
report of the existence of several millions of acres of
very beautiful and fertile land in the same district. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
climate of South Australia is healthy, though very
warm;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and the usual disorders of Australia, complaints
of the eye and relaxation of the bowels, were the ailments
least uncommon among the new settlers. In March
1841, the population of the colony was estimated at
about 14,000, and the amount of land under tillage about
2000 acres. But since that time there has been a considerable
increase in both items. The quantity of provisions
in proportion to the inhabitants was considerably
greater than in England. A small commerce is springing
up, and slate, which abounds in South Australia, and
oil, the produce of the adjacent seas, together with wool
from the flocks fed upon the neighbouring hills, begin to
form materials of traffic.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The capital of the province of South Australia bears
the honoured name of Adelaide, and is placed upon the
eastern side of the Gulf of St. Vincent. The country
around it is hilly and well timbered, but not too thickly
encumbered with wood, and the soil is generally good,
with abundance of water. The British settlers removed
to this spot from Kangaroo Island, which is at the
entrance of Gulf St. Vincent, but which they found less
desirable for a colony from the difficulty and expense of
clearing away the timber there. Adelaide is supposed
to be well and centrally placed for the capital of a
province, and it now has a good port,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> to which vessels
of four or five hundred tons may come and discharge
their cargoes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
The town stands on gently rising banks, between
which flows a pretty stream, named the Torrens, and
commands a view of an extensive plain, reaching down
to the sea, over which the fresh breezes generally blow
from the south-west. Behind Adelaide is a fine wooded
country, and six miles distant is a range of hills, with
the wooded summit of Mount Lofty forming their highest
point. The population of the capital of South Australia
and its immediate neighbourhood, is supposed to be
about eight thousand. The town has not yet many
buildings or establishments of any importance, but there
is a hospital, and also a savings&#8217; bank, in which last,
during six months of 1841, the deposits had increased from
130<em>l.</em> 0<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> to 520<em>l.</em> 2<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em>
It had <em>four</em> newspapers and <em>one</em> colonial chaplain in 1842,
and the estimates for that year contained the following items:&mdash;Police,
9112<em>l.</em> 19<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>; jail, 1034<em>l.</em> 8<em>s.</em>;
colonial chaplain, 370<em>l.</em> But we must do the colony of South
Australia the justice to state that this is not the whole sum which is
there spent on religious instruction. The voluntary system,
as it is called, has been brought into action there, and
hitherto, it would appear, successfully enough, so far as
pounds, shillings, and pence are concerned, if it be true
that in four years,&mdash;the four first years of the colony,&mdash;upwards
of 11,500<em>l.</em> had been voluntarily contributed for
religious and educational purposes, and &ldquo;the clergy,&rdquo;
(as all teachers are now denominated,) supported at an
annual charge of 1200<em>l.</em> But, of course, the voluntary
principle, as its name implies, is a little apt to be <em>wilful</em>;
and, accordingly, in Adelaide alone, with a population
of eight thousand souls, it is stated that there are ten
or twelve public &ldquo;places of worship,&rdquo; and a corresponding
number of &ldquo;zealous, highly-educated, and efficient clergymen.&rdquo;
Every settler apportions his mite
to Paul, to Apollos or to Cephas, according as it seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
right in his own eyes; and occasionally it may happen,
when any little offence is taken, that the popular saying
is actually realized, and Peter is robbed that Paul may
be paid. And to some persons, who cannot, one would
think, have read their Bible with much attention, this
system appears actually to be the very height of perfection.
The following brief quotation from a letter of the
Congregational teacher at Adelaide is said to be &ldquo;most satisfactory:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Religion.</em>&mdash;The whole circle of denominations is filled
up with their appropriate pastors, churches, and places
of worship. Adelaide is well supplied. The country is
not altogether neglected; but, as it fills up, will be better
attended to. I do not think the religious prospects bad.
Truth and piety, I expect, will flourish in South Australia.
The clergy of the Churches of England and Scotland
are evangelical; the Wesleyans have been very active
and useful. Of us, you read in the Report of the Colonial
Missionary Society. The other bodies are also making
their way.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Would this report of religion in South
Australia be &ldquo;most satisfactory&rdquo; to that apostle, who
teaches that &ldquo;there is <em>one</em> body, and <em>one</em> Spirit, even as
ye are called in one hope of your calling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still let us not judge harshly of the infant colony, nor
reproach it for a leprosy, with which it has been inoculated
by the mother country. While we hail with gladness
the good spirit which has been shown in raising so
much money for religious objects in the very infancy of
the settlement, let us hope, that the &ldquo;places of worship&rdquo;
may diminish in number, while the churches increase,
and that the country districts may have a larger share
of assistance than they can now receive out of what
remains of 1200<em>l.</em> a year, after Adelaide and its <em>ten</em> or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<em>twelve clergymen</em> have been supplied.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Undoubtedly, in
this province of Australia there is much zeal and good
feeling awakened, and the efforts of the South Australian
Church Building Society are deserving of every success.
To the members of this Society it must be indeed a
cause of thankfulness and joy, that they can call to mind
during the lapse of only four years, the quick succession
of an open spot, a tent, a reed hut, a wooden shed, and
lastly, a church capable of holding six hundred persons,
being respectively used for places of divine worship.
And now, not only do they see one church finished, but
two others are, ere this time, no doubt completed.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The British colony in the great southern land to which
the attention of the reader may next be directed, is that
of Western Australia; or, as it was called in its earlier
days, during its first struggles into existence, the Swan
River Settlement. This is situated upon the coast of
New Holland, opposite to the colony of New South
Wales, lying in nearly the same latitude, but thirty-four
or thirty-six degrees of longitude to the west of it. The
first discovery of this spot was made by a Dutchman,
Vlaming, in 1697, who named the stream Black Swan
River, from the black swans, which were then seen for
the first time by Europeans, and two of which were
taken alive to Batavia.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The banks of the Swan River
were first colonized in 1830, and the mode in which this
was effected is peculiar and different from the usual
course. A few gentlemen of large property undertook
to found the colony, at little or no expense to the mother
country, receiving immense grants of land in return for
the expenses incurred by them in this attempt; which
grants, however, were to revert to government, unless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
they were cultivated and improved under certain conditions
and in a given time. Great difficulties and many
privations were endured by the first settlers, but these
appear to have been overcome, and so soon as the stream
of emigration shall have set steadily into Western Australia,
(which is, perhaps, all things considered, the most
desirable of our Australasian colonies for a respectable
Englishman to fix himself in,) there can be little doubt
that its progress will be not less rapid than that of the
sister settlements. Along the sea coast, the country is
hilly and barren; nor is it much better in the immediate
neighbourhood of the principal settlements, Perth and
Fremantle; but beyond these there is plenty of good
grass country, and near the inland town of Guildford,
the arable land in the valley of the Swan River is surpassingly
rich and productive, so that it has been known
to bear eleven successive crops of wheat in as many
years, without any manure, and the last year&#8217;s crop
averaging twenty-five bushels to the acre. In some
parts this good land approaches more nearly to the
coast; but still a large proportion of the soil is poor
and sandy, although even of this a great deal is capable
of cultivation, and is thought to be especially fitted for
the growth of the vine.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The climate is exceedingly
healthy and delightful; indeed, it is even superior to
other parts of Australia, and rain is more abundant here
than elsewhere. Plenty of fish is likewise to be found
in the neighbouring bays and inlets, which are very
numerous; and the whales are so plentiful, only a few
hours&#8217; sail from the shore, that oil is a principal article
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of export, but the Americans are allowed to occupy this
fishery almost entirely, and it is stated that from two to
three hundred of their ships have been engaged in the
whale fishery off this coast during a single year. The
population of Western Australia is small, not being
computed at more than 2700 souls in the beginning of
the year 1842. The number of acres cultivated in 1840
were, according to the returns of the local Agricultural
Society, 1650 in wheat, and 3296 in every kind of
culture. This settlement is, more than others, in want
of that article of which England especially needs to be
relieved&mdash;population; and if a man is frugal, sober, and
industrious, if he will bear in mind that &ldquo;on no part of the
face of the globe will the earth yield her increase, but as
it is moistened by sweat from man&#8217;s brow,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Western
Australia is, possibly, the best and most agreeable
country where he can find a happy home. Although
this large district is yet so thinly peopled, it is,
nevertheless, in a state of colonization and civilization
surpassing what might have been fairly expected. And the
absence of convicts, though it renders labour scarce and
expensive, brings with it counterbalancing advantages,
and prevents the double danger of immediate taint to
society from the unhappy criminals, and of future schism
arising between the emancipated convicts, or their children,
and the free settlers.</p>

<p>Fremantle is at the mouth of the Swan River, and
contains some tolerable houses, with a jetty and various
other conveniences for trade, especially for the whale
fishery; from the ships engaged in which pursuit, (chiefly
American vessels,) a great portion of its commerce is
derived. One cause of its trade and population not
having increased more rapidly may be the bar across the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
mouth of the Swan River, having only a depth of six
feet at low water, and preventing the approach of ships
of large burden. The soil around is sandy, and produces
little or no grass; but when well cultivated, it yields
excellent vegetables. Two miles from Fremantle, up
the river, there is a ferry across to Perth, the seat of
government and capital of the colony, which is well
situated, the river extending into a broad sheet, named
Melville Waters, in front of the town. Here is good
brick-earth and garden-ground, and near the town there
are some tolerable farms. But at Guildford, seven
miles further up the river, commences the rich corn-land
of the colony, and the town itself contains six or
seven hundred inhabitants. York is forty-eight miles
eastward of Guildford; and King George&#8217;s Sound, on
the coast, where there is another settlement, is about
one hundred and fifty miles from York.</p>

<p>There are several other little stations scattered about
in various directions, especially upon the coast. In
1840 there were five clergymen in Western Australia,
and on the 1st of January, 1841, the foundation stone of
a church at Perth to contain 600 persons was laid by
the governor; its estimated cost was 4000<em>l.</em> There are
churches also at Guildford, at the Middle Swan, the
Upper Swan, and at York, and a new church erecting at
Albany, near King George&#8217;s Sound. Some humble little
churches have also been built of mud, and thatched with
rushes, in this colony. And although, where it can be
done, we think that noble churches are most becoming
to the service of the King of kings, yet we doubt not,
in the cases where these lowly buildings are unavoidable,
that since &ldquo;the chariots of God are twenty thousand, even
thousands of angels,&rdquo; so these ministering spirits are
sent forth into the wilderness to minister unto them that
are heirs of salvation: we confidently trust that &ldquo;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Lord is among them,&rdquo; even &ldquo;as in the holy place of
Sinai.&rdquo; Wesleyan meeting-houses are to be found at
Perth and Fremantle. The governor and executive
council were authorized to &ldquo;grant aid towards ministers&#8217;
stipends, and towards buildings, <em>without any distinction of
sect</em>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This precious system, which would make no
&ldquo;distinction of sect,&rdquo; between the doctrine of the
beloved apostle St. John, and that of the Nicolaitans,
&ldquo;which God hates,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> is almost a dead letter in Western
Australia, owing to the scattered state of the population,
and the great majority of them being members of the
Church of England. The duty of government to <em>tolerate</em>
separatists, (while they continue obedient to the laws of
the country,) is now denied by no one; and toleration,
one might have supposed, would have been all that
those who dislike a state church would have accepted;
but the duty of government to <em>encourage</em> and <em>foster</em>
separation in places where it does not at present exist,
is inculcated neither by reason, policy, nor Scripture;
neither can dissenters consistently accept of aid from the
state in Australia, and exclaim against it in England.</p>

<p>One more commencement of colonization in the
island of New Holland must be mentioned in order to
complete the circle. An attempt to form a settlement
on the northern coast was made as early as 1824, at
Melville Island, rather more than five degrees to the
west of the Gulph of Carpentaria; but this establishment
was moved in 1827 to Raffles Bay, an adjacent
inlet of the main land. The new station was in its turn
abandoned in the year 1829, and a fresh settlement, at
the distance of a few miles, was planted at Port Essington,
by Sir Gordon Bremer, who sailed thither with His
Majesty&#8217;s ships <em>Alligator</em> and <em>Britomarte</em>, in 1838. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
colony is still quite in an infant state. No clergyman
accompanied the expedition, although the commander
was desirous of securing the blessings of Church communion
for his little settlement.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> In the immediate
neighbourhood some native Christians (Australians)
were found, who had many years ago been converted by
the Dutch; they had churches, and appeared to behave
well. Upon application to the Bishop of Australia, 300<em>l.</em>
was obtained towards a church at Port Essington, and
his endeavours to get a chaplain appointed there were
promised. It may be observed that Port Essington is
situated 2000 miles, in a direct line, from Hobart Town,
and both places were until very recently within the
same diocese, that of Australia! In like manner, when
the five clergymen stationed in Western Australia
had memorialized the Bishop to visit them, that he
might consecrate their churches, confirm their children,
and &ldquo;set in order things that were wanting,&rdquo; one great
obstacle to his compliance was the necessity of having
his life insured in the interim, for Western Australia,
though within his diocese, was not within the limits of
his policy of life assurance!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES.</strong></p>


<p>Having now rapidly surveyed the various British
settlements in Australia, taking them separately, a few
observations may be added respecting their general condition.
And, first, of the <em>climate</em> of these countries, it
must have evidently appeared from what has been already
stated that this is extremely healthy and beautiful.
Every one who has been in Australia appears to be
surprised at the spring and elasticity which the climate
imparts to the human frame; and although it does
not seem that the average of life is at all more prolonged
there than in England, still it would really seem,
that the enjoyment of life was greater. Such declarations
as these.&mdash;&ldquo;To say we are all well is really nothing;&rdquo;
&ldquo;the full enjoyment of health is quite a marvel;&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
occur in the letters of those who are settled in
the great Southern Land; and the descriptions with
which we meet in books of its exhilarating climate,
completely justify and bear out the pleasing accounts of it
given us by its inhabitants. In so vast a territory, and in
so many different situations as the British colonies now
occupy, there must needs be great variety of climate;
and the warmth of Sydney and its neighbourhood forms
a strong contrast to the cool bracing air of Bathurst,
which is only 121 miles distant; the heat of the new
settlements at Moreton Bay, which is nearly tropical, is
strongly opposed to the English climate, beautifully
softened and free from damp, which is enjoyed in Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land. In Australia, it has been remarked,
every thing regarding climate is the opposite of England;
for example, the north is the hot wind, and the south
the cool; the westerly the most unhealthy, and the
east the most salubrious; it is summer with the colonists
when it is winter at home, and their midnight
coincides with our noonday. Near the coast, the sea
breezes, which set in daily from the great expanse of
waters, are very refreshing; whilst in the interior,
except in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, or in very high situations,
the hot winds are extremely disagreeable. Especially
in the colony of New South Wales, during the summer
season, the westerly wind, which blows probably over
immense deserts of sandstone, or over miles of country
set on fire by the natives, is scarcely endurable at
certain times, but feels like the heated air at the mouth
of a furnace, and is then far from wholesome or pleasant.
However, this blast of hot wind is said never to
endure very long, and it is less oppressive than the
same heat would be elsewhere, because in New Holland
the air is dry, and in other countries, India for instance,
when the heat is exactly the same, it is felt much more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
intensely from the quantity of moisture with which the
burning atmosphere is surcharged. Still we may form
an idea of the occasional violence of the heat in the interior
of New Holland, from Captain Sturt&#8217;s account of
his expedition across the parched-up marshes of the
Macquarie River, where the sugar which his men carried
in their canisters was melted, and all their dogs destroyed.</p>

<p>The scourge of Australia is <em>drought</em>; and when a native
of the British Islands has lived a few years in that part
of the world, he begins to understand and feel better
than he ever before did, the frequent allusions in the
holy Scriptures to water as an emblem and sign of the
greatest blessings. The Englishman in Australia soon
learns what is meant by the blessings of Christ&#8217;s kingdom
being compared to &ldquo;rivers of water in a dry place,&rdquo;
or to &ldquo;the shadow of a great rock in a weary land,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
when that rock promises a spring of living water, a
comfort which in New Holland is occasionally found upon
the bare top of a mountain, where no other supply is to
be had within thirty miles round.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> And the thankfulness
of the inhabitants of our own green islands may be
awakened, the undue expectations of the English emigrant
may be checked, by reading complaints like the
following, which are, at intervals, only too well founded
in many parts of the Australian colonies. &ldquo;We have
now for upwards of four months been watching with
anxious interest the progress of every cloudy sky;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
but, overcast as the heavens most usually are towards
evening, the clouds have appeared to consist more of
smoky exhalations than moist vapours; and even when
at times they have seemed to break darkly over us,
their liquid contents have apparently evaporated in the
middle air. The various arrivals in our port (Port
Macquarie) have brought us accounts of genial showers
and refreshing dews, which have visited the neighbouring
districts; and even the silence of our own parched
coast has been broken by the sound of distant thunderstorms,
exhausting themselves on the eastern waves
while the sun has been setting in scorching splendour
upon the horizon of our western hills. Since the 30th
of June last to the present date, October 28th, there
have been but thirteen days with rain, and then the
showers were but trifling. In consequence, the surface
of the ground, in large tracts of the district, is so
parched and withered, that all minor vegetation has
nearly ceased, and the wheat-crops that were sown in
June, are, we fear, doomed to perish.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>How expressive, after reading descriptions like this, do
those complaints of one of the inspired writers appear:
&ldquo;The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are
laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn
is withered. How do the beasts groan! the herds of
cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea,
the flocks of sheep are made desolate. O Lord, to thee
will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of
the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees
of the field. The beasts of the field cry also unto Thee,
for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire
hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.&rdquo; (Joel
i. 17-20.)</p>

<p>Most of the productions of the soil which are to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
found in the mother country are raised likewise in the
Australian settlements. The wheat-harvest commences
in New South Wales in the middle of November, and is
generally over by Christmas, so that to this festive
season a fresh cause of rejoicing is added, and men are
called upon to be thankful at once for the greatest temporal
and spiritual blessings; the same time of year
supplies them with the meat that perisheth, and reminds
them of the coming down from heaven of Him who is the
bread of life. But, besides the ordinary produce of our
English fields, many productions of the soil are raised
in Australia which will not grow in the northern climate
of Britain. The fruits of Italy and Spain, the tobacco
of Virginia, and the Indian corn of the southern states
of America, are all produced in the Australian colonies.
And one fruit may be particularly noticed, which is in
England justly reckoned a delicacy, but which in New
South Wales is so abundant, that the very swine are
feasted upon it: <em>peaches</em> are to be had in full perfection
for full four months in the year, the later varieties
regularly succeeding to those that are earlier. This
fruit grows everywhere, it matters not whether the soil
be rich or poor; and if a peach-stone is planted it will
in three years afterwards bear an abundant crop of
fruit. So plentifully do they grow, that they are commonly
used to fatten hogs, for which purpose they
answer very well, after having been laid in heaps, and
allowed to ferment a little; cider also of a pleasant and
wholesome quality is made from the same fruit.</p>

<p>The chief wealth of Australia consists in its flocks
and herds, and nothing in the progress of our settlements
there is more astonishing than the rapidity with which
these primitive riches have increased. Sixty years ago
there was not a single sheep in the vast island of New
Holland; and now, from a few narrow strips of land upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
some of its coasts, millions of pounds of wool are
annually exported to England. The fine climate of
Australia is especially suited for sheep, and it would
appear to have an improving effect upon the quality of
that animal&#8217;s fleece, which nowhere reaches greater perfection
than in New South Wales. Cattle also thrive
and increase very much in the Australian settlements,
and animals of all kinds in New South Wales are exceedingly
dainty: if shut up in a field of good grass
they will starve themselves with fretting rather than eat
it, they are so anxious to get out upon the sweet natural
pastures. Although it is to be hoped and expected that,
under judicious management, these colonies will always
be able to supply their inhabitants with bread, still it is
confessed on all sides that pastoral riches form their
natural source of wealth, and that it is to these chiefly,
together with their mineral productions and commerce,
that they must look for a foundation of permanent and
continued worldly prosperity.</p>

<p>The form of government is the same in all the British
Australasian colonies, and while the governor&#8217;s authority
is supreme, by virtue of his being the representative
of the British crown, his power is restrained by an executive
council and by a legislative council. The former
body, whose office is to assist the governor in carrying
the laws into execution, is composed of the colonial
secretary and treasurer, the bishop and lieutenant-governor,
(if the last-named office is not abolished,)
under the presidency of the governor himself. The
legislative council consists of the same persons, with the
addition of the chief justice, the attorney-general, the
chief officer of the customs, the auditor-general, and
seven private gentlemen of the colony, who are appointed
by the crown for life, and for whom, in case of death or
removal, the governor may choose a substitute, until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the Queen&#8217;s pleasure be known. The office of this legislative
council is, as its name implies, that of making
laws, in which, however, at least two-thirds of the
members must agree, and which must not be contrary
to the charter, or letters patent, or orders in council, or
laws of England. The proposal of new laws always
belongs to the governor, who must, however, give
eight clear days&#8217; notice in the public papers, stating the
general objects of the intended enactments; nor can
this rule be dispensed with, except in cases of very great
emergency. Such is briefly the outline of the constitution
at present established in the Australian settlements,
and under this form of government they have, most of
them, already run a race of prosperity, which, allowing
for the recent dates of their foundation, can scarcely be
matched in the annals of any nation. Nevertheless, the
present form of government is a very great subject of
discontent among many of the colonists, and the <em>want</em>
of a representative house of assembly in New South
Wales and Van Diemen&#8217;s Land appears to give as little
satisfaction to many persons <em>there</em>, as the <em>presence</em> of
such an assembly does <em>here</em> in England.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It may easily
be imagined what a fine subject for oratory is thus furnished
among a mass of people, who, whatever elements
of good may exist among them, may, generally speaking,
be too truly said to have derived their birth and education
from criminals and outcasts. In the midst of a
people thus constituted, a press &ldquo;unshackled by stamps,
paper-excise, advertisement duty, or censorship,&rdquo; is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
doing its daily or weekly work of <em>enlightening</em> the minds
of the people respecting their <em>grievances</em>; and where, as
in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, there is said to be a newspaper
for every 1666 free persons,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> the people must indeed
bask in the sunshine of political illumination. &ldquo;The
press,&rdquo; it is asserted on good authority respecting Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land, and it is not less true of New South
Wales, &ldquo;The press, with few exceptions, finds ample
support in holding up to derision the authorities of the
land, and even in the invasion of the sanctity of domestic
privacy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The result, however, of this state of things
is that, actually, in the colonies of Australia the grievances
appear worse, the &ldquo;wrongs&rdquo; more galling, and
the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; less regarded, than even in England itself;
and judging from the crabbed tone of discontent prevailing
in most of the colonial newspapers, the people who
live in a land almost free from taxes, and quite exempt
from tithes and poor-rates, can without much difficulty
conjure up complaints of taxation and oppression not less
piercing than those which are to be heard in a kingdom
where taxgatherers, tithe-proctors, and aristocrats, still
exist. Perhaps, there is nothing more calculated to
make an Englishman tolerably satisfied with the state
of things in his own country than the occasional perusal
of the newspapers of lands so &ldquo;highly favoured&rdquo; in the
way of &ldquo;taxation&rdquo; or &ldquo;liberal institutions,&rdquo; as the
Australian colonies and the United States of America.
The christian patriot looks down with pity upon the
strife of tongues and the turmoil of party-spirit which
Satan contrives to raise in almost every country under
the sun; and while the believer can always bless God&#8217;s
providence for many good things, he expects not perfection
in the institutions of mortal men; it is true that</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Worldly reformers, while they chafe and curse,</span><br />
 Themselves and others change from bad to worse;<br />
 While christian souls for blessings past can praise,<br />
 And mend their own and others&#8217; future ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great instruments by which the christian statesman
will aim at reforming mankind, and making them
happy, while at the same time he will be gaining the
highest of all glory to himself, both in time and
eternity, are christian instruction and religious education.
A corrupted press and incessant agitation are
instruments suitable enough to accomplish the works of
darkness for which they are usually employed; nor are
churches and schools less fit means of success in the
better and more honourable task of bringing a nation to
righteousness, respectability, and contentment. A short
account of the establishment of the Bishopric of Australia,
and a statement of the means of religious and
sound education in that part of the world, will not be
out of place here; and if, as before, we are driven to
speak of the neglect of &ldquo;the powers that be&rdquo; upon these
essential points, it is hoped that, since this is done
unwillingly,&mdash;more in shame and sorrow than in anger
and party-spirit,&mdash;it will not be done with a feeling at
all contrary to the Divine precept: &ldquo;Thou shalt not
speak evil of the ruler of thy people.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is evident unto all men diligently reading holy
Scripture and ancient authors, that from the Apostles&#8217;
time there have been these orders of ministers in Christ&#8217;s
Church,&mdash;Bishops, Priests, and Deacons;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and the
Church of England has never yet made bold to dispense
with what the Church of Christ did for 1500 years,
without a single exception, deem it necessary everywhere
to retain. Never <em>in theory</em>, indeed, has our Church made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
bold to work without the three orders of an apostolical
ministry, but, alas! frequently has she done this in
practice, and in no instance more openly or less successfully
than in Australia. For upwards of thirty years,
no superintendent at all was placed over the clergy and
laity of our communion in New South Wales, and when
a step was taken, it was not made in the right direction;
an archdeacon was appointed, who, whatever might be
his civil authority, was, respecting spiritual authority,
exactly upon a level with his other brethren in the
ministry; nor could he assume more than this without
assuming to himself that to which he was not entitled,&mdash;the
office of a bishop in the Church. Under these
strange and irregular circumstances was the infant
Church, brought from the British isles and planted in
the wilderness of Australia, allowed to continue for about
twelve years. The witness of a layman concerning this
state of things may be here repeated: &ldquo;I myself then
saw a church without a bishop, and I trust in God I may
never see it again.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In 1824, the Rev. T. H. Scott was
appointed Archdeacon of New South Wales, and there
were then eight chaplains in the colony, which covered
a vast expanse of country, and contained, in 1821, (three
years earlier,) 29,783 souls, of whom 13,814 were
convicts. Thus was New South Wales provided with
&ldquo;a very liberal ecclesiastical establishment,&rdquo; according
to the liberal views of one of its leading historians;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
and as its population increased, so, in some degree, if
not in an equal proportion, did the number of its clergy,
so that, in September, 1833, the number of souls in the
colony was 60,794,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> (of whom 16,151 were convicts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and 17,238 Roman Catholics,) and the number of clergymen
was fifteen, besides the archdeacon and four
catechists. Archdeacon Scott was succeeded, in 1829,
by the Rev. W. G. Broughton, whose zeal and activity
reflect honour alike upon himself and upon the discernment
of the noble patron, the Duke of Wellington, who,
it is believed, first recommended him to that office.
After enduring labour, and toil, and anxiety, such as
those only know who have to bear the heat and burden
of the day in the Lord&#8217;s vineyard, at length the
archdeacon was made, by permission of the English
government under Lord Melbourne, in 1836, Bishop of
Australia; and the foundation of an Apostolical and
Scriptural Church in the Great Southern Land was at
length duly laid, by the consecration of that prelate, at
Lambeth, on February 14th, 1836. The old stipend
assigned to the archdeacon was to be continued without
any increase to the Bishop of Australia; and since 2000<em>l.</em>
a-year was undoubtedly a very ample provision for the
former, it was thought that it might be found sufficient
for the latter; and so it would be, if the British government
were willing to provide properly for the spiritual
wants of the new diocese, and thus preserve the provision
made for the bishop from being almost entirely
swallowed up in endeavouring to satisfy the spiritual
need of his people. This observation, however, justice
compels us to make before we quit the present subject,
namely, that, whatever opinion may be entertained of
the dispositions of the British government, during
the ten years following the passing of the Reform
Bill, towards the English Church, for one fact every
member of that church must feel deeply indebted
to them. During the time of Lord Grey&#8217;s and Lord
Melbourne&#8217;s holding office, no less than <em>six</em> new bishoprics
were erected in the British colonies, and the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
impulse was encouraged of that good spirit which has
since sent forth into foreign parts five bishops in one
day to &ldquo;preach the word, to be instant in season, out of
season, to reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering
and doctrine.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Among the five new sees thus recently established,
the pressing necessities of Australia have not been overlooked;
and Tasmania, or Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, an island
equal in size to Ireland, has been thought to claim justly
a separate bishop for itself. The capital of this island
is not less than 600 miles distant from Sydney, the seat
of the bishopric of Australia; and with a population of
50,000, rapidly increasing, a large majority of whom are
churchmen, its claims to have a bishop of its own are
undeniable. And to these just claims the British government
have listened so far as to devote the 800<em>l.</em> per
annum formerly assigned to an archdeacon of Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land towards the endowment of a bishop
there, in addition to which sum 5000<em>l.</em> have been set apart
from the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, and the remainder
of what is necessary to provide the occupant of the new
see with a decent maintenance is now being raised among
those that feel interested in that particular colony, or in
the general good work whereof this endowment forms
only a part. Nor is it the intention of the promoters of
this noble design of founding in our Australian and other
colonies the complete framework of a Christian Church
to stop short here. South Australia, a province even
more thoroughly separated from Sydney than Tasmania
is, has appeared well deserving of the attention of those
that have the direction of this important work; and the
zeal of some of the landed proprietors of the colony has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
already prepared the way for the establishment of a
bishopric in South Australia. The following extract is
from the letter of a layman residing in the last-mentioned
colony:&mdash;&ldquo;At present, we are pronounced to be
in a diocese, whilst the head of that diocese is living
nearly 1200 miles away, and has never been here, and,
in all probability never will be.&rdquo; One person has offered
to build, at his own cost, with the tenth part of his
property in Australia, a church at Adelaide, to endow
the see with land to the amount of 270<em>l.</em> per annum,
and to furnish plans, &amp;c. for a bishop&#8217;s residence; other
gifts of land have likewise been contributed to the
amount of 100<em>l.</em> per annum more. A grant of 5000<em>l.</em>
has been obtained from the Colonial Bishoprics Fund,
and it is hoped that, by the efforts of the friends of
sound religion, an endowment of 1000<em>l.</em> per annum
may speedily be completed for the intended bishopric.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
And since the experience of the past forms a stable
foundation of hope for the future, we may form a judgment
of what <em>will be done</em>, under the Divine blessing, in
Tasmania and South Australia, by what <em>has been done</em> in
the diocese of Australia. In the charge of the bishop of
the last-named see, delivered by him to his clergy in
1841, it is stated, that, before 1836, the date of his
consecration, there were in the colony of New South Wales
nine churches, eight chapels, or school-houses used as
such, and five parsonage-houses; whereas, in 1841,
<em>nine</em> new churches had been completed, <em>four</em> had been
opened by licence, <em>fifteen</em> more were in course of erection;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and twelve new parsonages had been completed,
while eight others were also in progress!<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> So great a
stimulus, during only five years, had the presence of the
full and effective staff of an apostolical ministry added
to the growth and increase of the Church in one single
colony!</p>

<p>The history of education in the colony of New South
Wales is an important and deeply interesting subject;&mdash;indeed,
in what country is it not so?&mdash;but the struggles
and disappointments of the friends of sound religious
education,&mdash;of that education which an Englishman may
be thankful to be permitted to call National,&mdash;have been
very severe and trying. To borrow the language of an
able statesman and eloquent writer, &ldquo;not contented with
excluding religion from the province of government, the
spirit of the age struggles with not less zeal to introduce,
as its substitute, education; that is to say, the cultivation
of the intellect of the natural man instead of the
heart and affections of the spiritual man&mdash;the abiding in
the life of Adam, instead of passing into the life of
Christ.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> This is precisely what has taken place in
Australia. Only two years after the foundations of the
colony had been laid, George III. was pleased to provide
for the Church and for schools, by ordering the governor
to allot in every township 400 acres of land for the
maintenance of a minister, and 200 acres for the support
of a schoolmaster. This provision continued to be
assigned, and in many cases the portion of allotted glebe
became of considerable value; but, in 1826, a yet more
extensive and promising support was afforded by the
British government to the cause of religious instruction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
in New South Wales. The nature of this assistance may
be detailed first in the words of a violent and not very
sensible or consistent enemy of the Church of England,
and then the reader may turn to the account given by
one of its ablest and best friends. &ldquo;I was utterly
astounded,&rdquo; says Dr. Lang, &ldquo;in common with most of
the colonists, at the promulgation of a royal charter
appointing a Church and School Corporation for the
religious instruction, and for the general education of
the youth of the colony, <em>on the principles of the Church of
England, exclusively</em>, and allotting a seventh of the whole
territory, for that purpose, to the Episcopalian clergy,
with free access, in the meantime, to the colonial
treasury-chest. It will scarcely be believed that so
wanton an insult as this precious document implied,
could have been offered to the common sense of a whole
community, even by the late tory administration; or
that men could have been found in the nineteenth
century to perpetrate so gross an outrage on the best
feelings of a numerous body of reputable men.&rdquo; During
the ensuing four or five years, we are told by the same
authority that it was completely in the power of the
archdeacon and clergy &ldquo;to have formed a noble institution
for the general education of the youth of
Australia with the very crumbs that fell from their
corporation-table.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> They might, &ldquo;if they had only
been possessed of the smallest modicum of common
sense, have secured the exclusive predominance of episcopacy
in the management of the education of the whole
colony, <em>for all time coming</em>.&rdquo; And yet, adds the sagacious
Scotchman, in the very next paragraph, &ldquo;the yoke must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
have proved intolerable in the end, and would sooner or
later have been violently broken asunder during some
general burst of public indignation.&rdquo; After a grievous
misrepresentation of the expenses incurred by the Church
and School Corporation,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and a sneer at the want of
education which is said to prevail among its members,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
Dr. Lang contrives at last to land himself, if
not his readers, at the desired conclusion, namely, that
&ldquo;ignorance is the mother of devotion&rdquo; to colonial episcopacy!</p>

<p>But it is time to turn away from the pitiable spectacle
of a man calling himself a minister of God&#8217;s word,
but far better qualified for his other occupation, that of
editing a party newspaper in a penal colony, and taking
our leave of Dr. Lang with feelings of regret that he has
not made a better use of those talents which have been
given him: let us turn to the statement given by Judge
Burton, of the Church and School Corporation in New
South Wales. It is correct that one-seventh part in
extent and value of the land in New South Wales, was
intended to be set apart for the supply of religious
instruction and education to the whole colony. It is
true, likewise, that the English government, in 1826,
entrusted this endowment for these good purposes
entirely to the Church of England; and to what other
body could a thoroughly English government have
entrusted it? What course could be more suitable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the principles of the English constitution? Or who in
those days suspected the very dissenters, who in England
regard the help of the state as an abomination, of being
anxious themselves to partake freely of that help in
Australia? However, the arrangements were completed,
and the charter of the Church and School Corporation
was signed in 1826; and at the same time the burden
of defraying the regular expenses of the existing clergy
and schools, was immediately transferred from the parliamentary
grants and the colonial revenue to the newly
formed corporation. But, whatever might have been
the future value of the endowment thus bestowed upon
the Australian Church, its immediate produce was little
or nothing; the reserves are stated to have not been
fairly portioned out, many of them were allotted in
inconvenient or distant situations and unprofitable
soils; private interest was allowed to take the first
place in the division of land, and persons who would
have scorned to defraud men, were happy to be allowed
to rob God of his rights and the poor of the means of
having the gospel preached to them. Nor, even although
these hindrances had not arisen, would there have
been any sufficient income arising during the first years
from the property of the corporation, unless they had
sold this with utter recklessness of the means of securing
a future permanent endowment. That portion of their
lands which was most improved, was either judiciously
sold, or else let; and other parts of it were gradually
being brought under cultivation, and improved in value;
but meanwhile the increasing yearly expenses of the
ecclesiastical establishment were to be met. For this
purpose, some money was borrowed on debentures, and
an advance was made to the corporation from the
colonial treasury; and thus, during three years, were
the exertions of the corporation crippled and restrained.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
When they were beginning to get somewhat clear of
these first difficulties, when their estates were becoming
profitable, and their flocks and herds increasing, they
were directed to suspend any further proceedings, no
more lands were granted them, and they were informed
that their charter was to be revoked. This notification
was made in 1829, though the revocation did not actually
take place till 1833.</p>

<p>In reply to the inquiry, why the Church and School
Corporation in New South Wales should have been thus
suddenly dissolved, and that, too, at the very time when
its means were beginning to be available for the fulfilment
of the intentions of its foundation, no other answer
can be found besides that suggested by Judge Burton.
It was done, no doubt, by way of yielding to the
clamour of the secret and open enemies of the Church of
England; and the very opposition of Infidels, Romanists,
and Dissenters, combined, in jarring harmony,
together, bears a strong witness of the value of the
object of attack. The sop that was thus thrown to the
greedy demon of religious strife, was by no means successful
in satisfying or appeasing him; like most other
similar concessions, it served only to whet the appetite
for more; and it is to God&#8217;s undeserved mercies, not to
her own efforts, or to the wisdom of her rulers, that
England herself owes the preservation at that time of
her national Church. And now that the Church and
School Corporation in Australia has been abolished
these ten years, what are the results; who is the better
for its destruction? If this establishment had been permitted
to remain, &ldquo;certainly, at this day its funds would
have been sufficient to relieve the government altogether
of the charge of maintaining the clergy and schools of the
colony.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The estimated expenses of &ldquo;Church establishments,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and &ldquo;school establishments,&rdquo; for New South
Wales in 1842, were respectively, 35,981<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em>, and
16,322<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em>,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> so that by this time the saving to government,
arising from the continuance of the corporation,
would have amounted to no trifling annual sum. But,
what is of far more importance, and what was foreseen
by the enemies of the Church of England when they
compassed the ruin of the corporation, the means of
&ldquo;lengthening its cords and strengthening its stakes,&rdquo;
would have been placed within the power of the Australian
Church. And since, under every disadvantage,
during the short time in which the charter continued to
be in force, &ldquo;the churches were increased in number and
better provided, the schools were considerably more
than doubled in number, and their effectiveness increased,
while their expenses were lessened,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> what
might have been expected from the same instrument in
a longer period of time, and after the first difficulties
had been overcome? However, for wise and good
purposes, no doubt, it was not permitted that the experiment
should be tried; and while we regret that the
Church in Australia is not more efficient and better
supported than it is, we may yet feel thankful that, by
the grace of God, it is as it is.</p>

<p>It affords a sad proof of the continued enmity of the
world against Christ, to turn from the noisy outcries of
the children of Mammon about economy and ecclesiastical
expenses, and to fix our eyes upon the plain matter
of fact. When it was confidently asserted, by the
highest colonial authority, that the wants of the Australian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Church were fairly supplied, the Bishop, in 1837,
mentioned by name no less than fifteen places where
clergymen were immediately needed. And it is no uncommon
occurrence, as in the church at Mudgee, (quite
in the wilderness,) for a consecration to take place, the
church to be filled, the inhabitants around delighted,
their children baptized, and then the building is closed
for an indefinite period, until some clergyman be found
to officiate! Some persons may hold that to <em>save money</em>
is better than to <em>save souls</em>, but let not these men aspire
to the name of Christians.</p>

<p>But, in spite of such enemies, whether endowed or not,
whether supported or spurned by the state authorities,
the Church is likely to prove a blessing and a safeguard
to our Australian colonies. The absence of endowment,
the want of worldly means of extension, these are losses
not to the Church, but to the state. And while each
individual member is bound to spare of his abundance,
or even of his poverty, for a work so good and holy as
that of propagating the gospel in foreign parts, especially
in our colonies;<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> while every lawful effort is to be
made to do what we can to resist the progress of evil,
we may be satisfied to wait quietly the result. Nor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
among other acts of christian charity, will a faithful
member of Christ&#8217;s visible Church ever forget to pray
for those unhappy men whose extraordinary professions
of religion are too often found to end in fruits like
these,&mdash;in opposing all extension of what they deny not
to be, in the main, a scriptural Church, in straining at
the smallest particle of endowment, or public assistance
for religious objects at home, whilst abroad they
can swallow a whole camel&#8217;s load of public money
or church plunder, when it serves their occasion! May
God, in his wisdom, overrule the mischief, and in his
mercy forgive the evils of which men of this description
have recently been the occasion, both in England and
in its colonies!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>CONVICT POPULATION.</strong></p>


<p>Whatever may be the natural charms or advantages
of any region, these are nothing without inhabitants;
and however abundantly the means of riches, the comforts,
luxuries, or necessaries of life may be scattered
around, these are comparatively lost without man to
enjoy and to use them. The garden of Eden itself was
not perfected until beings were placed in it capable of
admiring its beauties and rejoicing in its blessings. And
in every country, especially in a civilised country, when we
have gone through the length and breadth of the land,
examining its natural features and speculating upon its
capabilities and future destiny, there is still left a most
interesting and important subject of consideration, nor
can our knowledge of any region be reckoned complete,
until we are acquainted with the present condition of its
inhabitants. In the preceding pages it has been found
impossible, indeed, to avoid frequently touching upon
a topic, which is so closely interwoven with the whole
subject; but there still remains abundance of miscellaneous
information concerning the present state of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
inhabitants of the Australian colonies to be detailed,
without which, indeed, the task we have undertaken
would be left altogether incomplete.</p>

<p>Though intellectual man is the principal object in
God&#8217;s creation upon earth, yet it is not the mere
&ldquo;march of intellect,&rdquo; but it is the advancement of truth
and righteousness,&mdash;the gradual outpouring of that
knowledge of God which shall cover the earth as the
waters cover the seas,&mdash;that can cause &ldquo;the desert to
rejoice and blossom as the rose.&rdquo; The recollection,
therefore, of the sort of men with whom Great Britain
has partly peopled the lonely shores of Australia,&mdash;the
remembrance that these men, too morally diseased to
be allowed to remain among ourselves, have been cast
forth to die, with little or no thought about bringing
them to the Great Physician of souls to be made whole,&mdash;these
reflections have before been offered, and must here
be repeated again. We read with pleasure and interest
of benevolent travellers, anxious to benefit the countries
which they are exploring, scattering around them in
favourable spots the seeds of useful plants and noble
trees, in the hope that these may hereafter prove beneficial
to generations yet unborn. And in like manner
may the mother country be said to scatter abroad in her
colonies the seeds not only of good, but of evil also.
Many admirable institutions, not a few excellent individuals
and christian families, have been planted in
Australian lands; a branch of Christ&#8217;s Church has been
placed there, and has taken firm hold of the soil, and
numberless other promises of future excellence may be
traced by the thankful and inquiring mind. But then,
on the contrary, we must not lose sight of the tares
that are so abundantly springing up together with the
wheat; it is impossible to deny that rank and poisonous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
weeds have there been scattered along with the good
seed, nay, instead of it. What might have been the
present state of Australia, if all, or almost all, its free
inhabitants had been faithful Christians, steadfast &ldquo;in
the Apostles&#8217; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking
of bread and in prayers?&rdquo; How great an effect might
the &ldquo;salt,&rdquo; thus placed in those remote parts of the
earth, have had in rescuing from corruption that mass
of uncleanness, which has been removed thither from
our own shores! Now, alas! nowhere more than in
some of the Australian settlements &ldquo;are the works of
the flesh manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>One cause, unquestionably, of the peculiar prevalence
of many of these evil works is the strange elements of
which society in Australia is composed. In its lowest
rank is found the unhappy criminal, whose liberty has
been forfeited, and who is, for a time at least, reduced
to a state of servitude in punishment of his offences.
Next to this last-named class come the <em>emancipists</em>, as
they are called, who have once been in bondage, but by
working out their time, or by good conduct, have
become free; these and their descendants constitute a
distinct and very wealthy class in New South Wales and
Van Diemen&#8217;s Land. The third and highest class is
formed of men who have settled as free persons in the
colonies, and of their descendants; and between this last
class and the two first a considerable distinction is kept
up, from which, (it has already been noticed,) miserable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
dissensions, jealousies, and heartburnings, have frequently
arisen. To an impartial person, beholding these
petty discords from the contrary side of the globe, it is
pretty plain that both classes are in fault.</p>

<p>It is well known that the system of assigning convicts
to various masters has been practised ever since the
colony at Port Jackson was first established, and thus
the expense of maintaining so many thousands of people
has been thrown upon the settlers, who were amply
repaid by the value of their labour; by means of which,
likewise, the land was brought into cultivation, and the
produce of the soil increased. One great argument
against the system of transportation, as a punishment,
is drawn from this practice of assignment, which, it is
asserted, makes the penalty &ldquo;as uncertain as the diversity
of temper, character, and occupation amongst human
beings can render it.&rdquo; Certain rules and conditions
were laid down for the treatment of convict servants,
and if these behave themselves well, they are allowed
&ldquo;a ticket of leave,&rdquo; extending over a certain district,
within which the holder of the ticket becomes, in fact,
a free person; subject, however, to the loss of this
privilege in case of his committing any offence. After
a certain number of years, the holder of the ticket of
leave is allowed to receive a &ldquo;conditional pardon,&rdquo; which
extends only to the limits of the colony, but is no longer
liable to be withdrawn at the will of government. The
&ldquo;absolute pardon,&rdquo; of course, extends everywhere, and
restores the party receiving it to all the rights and
privileges of a British subject.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The custom of assigning
male convicts has, however, been discontinued lately in
the elder colony, although women are still assigned to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the settlers by government, or at least were so until
very recently. But besides the employment of the convicts
by private persons, a vast number of these are constantly
engaged in public works, and to the facility of obtaining
labour thus afforded does New South Wales owe some of
its greatest improvements, especially in roads, bridges,
public buildings, and the like undertakings. It is
scarcely to be supposed that employment of this kind,
when the men must necessarily work in gangs, is so
favourable for their moral improvement and reformation
as residence in a private family and occupation in rural
pursuits is generally likely to prove; though the contrary
notion is supported in the recent Report of the
Transportation Committee, since, in the former case, they
are under stricter discipline. However, it has always
been customary to make the public works a sort of
punishment, and private service a reward for convicts;
and those that have been returned from the latter with
complaints, are usually put upon the roads for at least
six months; so that, if this system really stands in the
way of the improvement of offenders, it keeps those that
conduct themselves well from the beginning quite clear
of the bad example of less hopeful characters. It is
a sad truth, however, in Australia, as it often is found
to be in England, that &ldquo;the most skilful mechanics are
generally the worst behaved and most drunken,&rdquo; and,
consequently, most liable to punishment in the public
gangs.</p>

<p>By way of introducing the reader to the kind of life
led by those unhappy beings who labour in Australia
at the public roads, and to give him also some idea of
the spiritual work which the ministers of Christ&#8217;s Church
in a penal colony may be called upon to perform, the
following sketch from a private letter will be not unacceptable:&mdash;&ldquo;In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
a few minutes I am at the stockade
where more than 60 men are immediately mustered; the
[Roman] &lsquo;Catholics&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> are sent back to their boxes, the
&lsquo;Protestants&rsquo; assemble under a shed, open on two sides,
and filled with a few coarse boards for tables and forms,
where the men get their meals. Their boxes are wooden
buildings of uniform structure, in which the prisoners
are locked up from <em>sundown</em> to sunrise. The roof is
shingled, the sides are weather-board, the door in the
middle is secured by a padlock, and above the door is a
grating to admit the light and air, a similar grating being
placed exactly opposite to it. The internal arrangements
are simple in the extreme, where you see a gangway in
the middle, and two tiers of hard planks or dressers for
the men to lie upon; their bedding being, I believe, only
a blanket. As there is no division to form separate
bed-places, the four-and-twenty or thirty men who share
these boxes lie like the pigs, and make the best of it
they can. When a prisoner has served his time in
irons, he is removed to a probationary gang; that which
I am describing is an ironed gang. These men are
dressed in a motley suit of grey and yellow alternately,
each seam being of a different colour; and the irons
being secured to each ancle, and, for the relief of the
wearer, made fast from the legs to the waist. The whole
stockade is sometimes enclosed with high palings, and
sometimes open. The service of the Church is performed
under the shed where the men assemble for meals. The
men behave well or ill as the sergeant in charge takes an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
interest in it or not. Here the sergeant and a dozen
young soldiers are constant at prayers. The responses
are given by all that can read, our blessed societies
having furnished Bibles and Prayer-books for all.
Every change of position is attended with the clank of
chains, which at first harrows your soul: but time does
wonders, you know; you forget the irons after a while.
A full service and a sermon. You hear an application
or two from prisoners about their worldly matters,&mdash;chiefly
from the craftiest, oldest hands; wish them good
morning, and away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now half-past ten: there lies the hot and dusty
road before you, without shelter of any kind, and the
sun pours down his fiery beams; no cloud, no intermission.
If a breeze blows, it may be hotter than from
the mouth of a furnace. Well, courage; step out, it is
five miles to the other stockade. A flock of sheep,&mdash;the
dog baying, the driver blaspheming; a dray or two of
hay; a few carts loaded with oranges. Up the hill, down
the hill, and so on, till, a little after twelve, you arrive at
the other stockade. This is a probationary gang, that
is to say, it is composed of those against whom complaints
have been made by their respective masters,
and who are not assignable to other individuals for
six months. In this gang are six-and-twenty persons, of
whom two are [Roman] &lsquo;Catholics.&rsquo; No motley dress,
but all in dark grey; no irons. A corporal and one
private for a guard, and both of them exemplary at
prayers. Here I have the afternoon service. Generally
about this time the wind is up; and here, in a
state of perspiration, the breeze gives me a thorough
chilling under the open shed; and often clouds of dust
come rushing through upon us, as bad as the worst
days in March along one of the great roads in England.
But the service is attended in a gratifying manner, insomuch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
that it would shame many home congregations.
The corporal here teaches the poor fellows who require
it to <em>read and write</em>, so that even here we find instances
of christian charity, without sinister or vain motives,
which may well stimulate us and provoke our exertions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this picture of the condition of some of those
convicts that are undergoing punishment, we may turn
to the more pleasing view, which a gentleman of large
property in Australia, Mr. Potter Macqueen, has drawn
of the condition of his own assigned servants. Of course,
much of the chance of the servant&#8217;s improvement must
depend, humanly speaking, upon the sort of master into
whose hands he is thrown, and Mr. Macqueen would
appear to have behaved kindly and judiciously to those
entrusted to his care. Occasionally a severe example
of punishment was made, and extra labour or stoppage
of indulgences, as milk, tea, sugar, or tobacco, were
found effectual correction for most faults, whilst additional
industry was rewarded by fresh indulgences. Of
some deserving men Mr. Macqueen had even brought
over the wives and families at his own expense. And
what, in this world, could be a greater instance of the
luxury of doing good than to behold the family and
partner of one who has, though a convict, conducted
himself well, restored once more to their long-lost parent
and husband, and settled in his new country as pledges
of his future continuance in well-doing? Marriage, altogether,
was encouraged on the estate of the gentleman
already mentioned, as a means of recalling the convicts
from bad habits, and urging them to industry and good
behaviour; and this wise course has been generally
rewarded by witnessing their happiness, and receiving
their gratitude. During five years of residence in
Australia about two hundred convicts and ticket-of-leave
men passed through Mr. Macqueen&#8217;s establishment,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and the following account is interesting, since it serves
to show what <em>may be done</em>, even with a convict population:&mdash;</p>

<p>To encourage reformation, and check that spirit of
idleness which is the mother of mischief, alike in convicts
and free people, it is strongly recommended to
allow the well-disposed men to profit by their own
industry. It is forbidden to pay money to prisoners, at
least before they obtain their ticket, but they may be
rewarded by tea, sugar, tobacco, Cape wine, extra
clothing, &amp;c. Mr. Macqueen had one Scotchman, who,
under this system, actually sheared 101 sheep in the
day, being allowed at the rate of 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per score upon
all above 25, which is the quantity fixed by the government
rule for a man to do in a single day. And in the
same establishment, acting upon like inducements, might
be seen sawyers and fencers working by moonlight; and
others making tin vessels for utensils, bows for bullocks,
&amp;c., in their huts at night. From this method of management
a very great degree of comfort arises, of which
Mr. Macqueen gives the following instance in a convict&#8217;s
feast, which he once witnessed. At Christmas, 1837,
one of his assigned servants, (who had a narrow escape
from capital conviction at home,) requested leave to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
draw the amount of some extra labour from the stores,
since he wished to give an entertainment to a few of his
colleagues, all of whom were named and were well
conducted men. The party making this application had
been industrious and well-behaved, being besides very
cleanly in his hut, and attentive to his garden and
poultry, so the request was granted, and his master had
the curiosity to observe the style of the festival. The
supper consisted of good soup, a dish of fine mullet out
of the adjoining river, two large fowls, a piece of bacon,
roast beef, a couple of wild ducks and a plum-pudding,
accompanied by cauliflower, French beans, and various
productions of his garden, together with the delicious
water-melon of the country; they had a reasonable
quantity of Cape wine with their meal, and closed their
evening with punch and smoking.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>But the picture of the peculiar class by which a penal
colony is distinguished from all others will not be complete
without a darker shade of colouring than those
upon which we have been gazing. It is a painful feeling
to contemplate the past condition of one portion of the
convict population, but it is a wholesome exercise of the
mind, and has already produced an improvement in that
wretched state. Besides, it surely is only fitting that a
great, a free, and enlightened nation should know what is
the ultimate fate of a part of its outcast population; nor
need Englishmen shrink from hearing the <em>history</em>, whilst
England herself shrinks not from inflicting the <em>reality</em> of
those horrors which have defiled the beautiful shores of
Norfolk Island.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In 1834 Judge Burton visited this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
spot, the penal settlement of a penal settlement, for the
purpose of trying 130 prisoners, who had very nearly
succeeded in overpowering and murdering the military,
after which they intended to make their escape. Eight
years before this time, Norfolk Island had been first
made a penal settlement; and never during all that
period had its wretched inhabitants received any such
reproof, consolation, or instruction as the Church gives
to its members. The picture presented before the mind
of the judge was an appalling one, and he can speak of
Norfolk Island only in general terms, as being &ldquo;a cage
full of unclean birds, full of crimes against God and man,
murders and blasphemies, and all uncleanness.&rdquo; We
know well what bad men are in England. Take some
of the worst of these, let them be sent to New South
Wales, and then let some of the very worst of these
worst men be again removed to another spot, where
they may herd together, and where there are no pains
taken about their moral or religious improvement,
where, literally speaking, no man careth for their
souls:&mdash;such was Norfolk Island. And what right had England
to cast these souls, as it were, beyond the reach of
salvation? Where was the vaunted christian feeling of
our proud nation when she delivered these poor creatures
over to the hands of Satan, in the hope that her
worldly peace, and comfort, and property might be no
longer disturbed by their crimes? Had she ordered her
fleet to put these men ashore on some desolate island to
starve and to die, the whole world would have rung with
her cruelty. But now, when it is merely their souls that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
are left to starve, when it is only the means of eternal
life that they are defrauded of, how few notice it, nay,
how few have ever heard of the sin in which the whole
nation is thus involved!</p>

<p>One of the prisoners tried in 1834 was a man of singular
ability and great presence of mind, and by him Norfolk
Island was represented to be a &ldquo;hell upon earth;&rdquo;
and so it was as far as the company of evil spirits glorying
in evil deeds could make it. &ldquo;Let a man&#8217;s heart,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;be what it will, when he comes here, his
man&#8217;s heart is taken from him, and there is given to him
the heart of a beast.&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;It was no mercy
to send us to this place; I do not ask life, I do not want
to be spared, on condition of remaining here; life is not
worth having on such terms.&rdquo; Another unhappy being
was sentenced to die, and began passionately to exclaim
and entreat that he might not die without confession.
&ldquo;Oh, your honour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you hope to be saved
yourself, do not let me die without seeing my priest. I have
been a very wicked man indeed, I have committed many
other crimes for which I ought to die, but do not send
me out of the world without seeing my priest!&rdquo; This
poor man was a Roman Catholic; he seems not to have
known that he might go at once to his Heavenly Father
with a heartfelt acknowledgment of his faults, and so he
obtained a rude figure of the cross, and in miserable agony
pronounced before that, as he embraced it, his brief
exclamations for mercy. Others mentioned in moving
terms the hopelessness of their lot, and another of them
spoke also of what rendered the state they were in one
of utter despair; and the statement which he made was
perfectly true: he said, addressing the judge, &ldquo;What is
done, your honour, to make us better? once a week we
are drawn up in the square opposite the military barrack,
and the military are drawn up in front of us with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
loaded muskets and fixed bayonets, and a young officer
then comes to the fence, and reads part of the prayers,
and that takes, may be, about a quarter of an hour, and
<em>that is all the religion that we see</em>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Urged by appeals like these, which no heart could well
resist, Judge Burton reprieved the convicted prisoners,
until the whole case should be laid before the government,
and at least religious consolation and assistance
might be obtained for those who were to suffer capital
punishment. Eleven of the prisoners were afterwards
executed, but not without having been visited by ministers
of religion, who were sent for that express purpose
from Sydney. The kind and christian judge exerted
himself in behalf of the outcast population of Norfolk
Island, &ldquo;that modern Gomorrah,&rdquo; as it has been called;
and, as usual, improvement in bodily comforts or morals
was much more willingly undertaken by those in authority
than spiritual reformation. His advice respecting
the propriety of diminishing the number of prisoners
confined together was speedily attended to. His efforts
to procure religious reproof, instruction, and consolation
were not so soon successful; they were, however, nobly
continued, and at length both Protestant and Roman
Catholic chaplains were appointed to the island. But
this great object was not gained without <em>giving offence</em>.
Strange that any party could take offence at efforts of
this description, and stranger still that men professing
a general regard for religion, and avowedly possessed of
consciences exquisitely tender, and of charity unbounded,
should, notwithstanding, object to the conscientious and
charitable efforts in the cause of religion of which we
have just been speaking! However, these impotent
struggles have signally failed, and now there are clergy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
both of the English and Roman Church in Norfolk
Island, while the moral condition of the prisoners there
is stated to have improved greatly. In 1837 the Rev.
Mr. Sharpe was removed thither, at his own request,
from Pitt Town in New South Wales, and his labours
and ministrations are said to have been useful and
effectual. But even here, in this effort to save some of
Christ&#8217;s lost sheep, the unhappy circumstances of our
penal colonies were manifested. When Mr. Sharpe was
removed to Norfolk Island, a larger and more important
sphere of usefulness, his little parish on the Hawkesbury,
was for a time left without a pastor. And this distressing
trial is frequently occurring; when illness, or death,
or removal, deprives a parish of its spiritual shepherd,
for a time at least his place is liable to be left vacant,
and his people likely to become as sheep going astray.
It appears likewise, from the Report of the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, that an assistant-chaplain for
Norfolk Island was appointed in 1841. There have been
two clergymen of the Church of Rome in the island
ever since 1838, an arrangement which was alleged to be
necessary, in order that the chaplain himself might not
be deprived of private confession and absolution.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> There
was no church in the island a few years ago, but a room
in one settlement and a barn in the other were the places
where divine service was regularly attended. Besides
the Morning and Evening Prayers on Sunday, divine
service takes place five times during the week, twice in
the gaol, twice in the hospital, and once a week for
those men who are exempt from work, their sentences
having expired. There may, as has been stated, be much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
hypocrisy in Norfolk Island,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> but surely the spirit
which was offended at efforts that have wrought even
these changes in a spot of extreme moral and religious
desolation, may, without breach of charity, be pronounced
to have been an unclean and evil spirit. Can
this language be justly deemed too strong, when the
facts already stated are borne in mind; when, (to sum
up the whole case in a single example,) it is remembered
that in one year, 1838, the colonial government of New
South Wales paid 57,740<em>l.</em> 11<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> for its
police establishment and gaols, while the very utmost that was
spent in providing religious instruction for <em>all the prisoners</em>
within the limits of the colony amounted, during
the same period, to less than 1000<em>l.</em>?<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>It is stated on good authority,&mdash;that of Sir George
Arthur, who was formerly governor of Van Diemen&#8217;s
Land,&mdash;that not more than <em>two</em> convicts in every <em>hundred</em>
quit the colony and return to England.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The expense and
difficulty of procuring a passage home operates as a sufficient
check to prevent this being frequently obtained;
nor, supposing that the English people would act in a
kind and christian spirit towards the most deserving men
of this class, would either they or the nation be losers.
If the wives and families of the most meritorious men
could be brought out to them at the public cost, what
reasonable cause of regret would an emancipated convict
feel for his home,&mdash;the scene of his crimes and of
his disgrace,&mdash;in the mother country? And with
respect to the great objection,&mdash;the <em>cost</em> of such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
system,&mdash;what would that be compared with the advantage
which the rapid increase of an English population
in Australia is sure to bring, by creating fresh
demands for our goods and manufactures? If ours were
a wise and understanding nation, if we would spend a
portion of our riches in promoting the morals, the comfort,
and the religious instruction of our outcast population,
we might, in numberless instances, turn the very
dregs of our people into means of increasing our prosperity;
we might frequently render those that are now
the mere refuse of the earth, happy, contented, loyal
subjects; and the blessings of them that were ready to
perish spiritually would be continually resounding from
the far distant shores of Australia upon that Divine
Mercy which would have all men to be saved, and upon
that nation which would thus have offered itself to be a
willing agent and instrument for the furtherance of this
gracious design.</p>

<p>In the present condition of New South Wales and
Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, with so large a proportion of their
population in bondage, and such slender means of moral
improvement and religious instruction provided for them
by the mother country, it would be unreasonable to hope
that the convict population can be otherwise than very
bad. There may be many exceptions; and at the end
of all things here below, it may be found that some of
those poor outcasts, and some of the men who have cast
them forth to perish, and now despise them, may fill,
respectively, the places of the Publican and Pharisee in
our Lord&#8217;s parable; the convict may leave the throne of
judgment justified rather than his master; the poor repentant
criminal may be pardoned, while the proud one,&mdash;the
self-sufficiency of the nation, by which he was
transported, and left without further care,&mdash;may be
condemned. Still, however, the general character of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the convicts is undoubtedly bad; and the various modes
of deceit and dishonesty practised upon their masters,
the love of gambling, of strong liquors, and of every
kind of licentiousness prevailing in the penal colonies,
would fill a volume of equal size and interest with that
which is said to be a favourite book in New South
Wales,&mdash;the Newgate Calendar. Those that are curious
upon these subjects may be referred to the thick volume
in blue cover, which contains an account of the labours
of the Committee upon Transportation, 1837; but when
the evidence therein contained is read, it must be with
some grains of allowance; the avowed object of Sir W.
Molesworth&#8217;s motion for the committee, was enmity
against the whole system of transportation; and a large
majority of those that sat in the committee were, it is
believed, of his opinion; at all events, they belonged to
his party in politics. So that, before justice can be
done to the real state of the convicts, we want to have
evidence of an opposite tendency, like that of Mr. Potter
Macqueen, already quoted; and before the question,
whether transportation is a desirable mode of punishing,
or a likely means of reforming criminals, can be
fairly decided, inquiry must be made, not respecting what
<em>has been done</em>, but respecting what <em>might have been done</em>,
or <em>may even yet be done</em>, in our penal colonies.</p>

<p>Before the subject of the convict population is dismissed,
it may be well to notice those called <em>specials</em>;
that is, men of education, and of a somewhat higher
rank in life than the generality of exiles in New South
Wales. These were formerly treated with great consideration;
for, after having passed a short period of
probation, they were employed as clerks to auctioneers
or attornies; nay, the instruction of youth was too
often, in default of better teachers, committed into their
hands. Nor was this all. In former times, persons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
this description have been very much connected with
the public press; and the enlightened people of New
South Wales have sometimes, it may be feared, been
blindly led by an unprincipled convict, when they
imagined that they were wisely judging for themselves.
The reformation of these <em>specials</em> is said to be more
hopeless than that of other prisoners; and very commonly
they are confirmed drunkards. Strange materials
these from which to form instructors for youth, trustworthy
agents of private property, or leaders of public
opinion! However, by the progress of emigration, the
influence of these men is now superseded; besides which,
they have been gradually removed from the government
offices, and those that now arrive are employed in hard
labour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>EMANCIPISTS AND FREE POPULATION.</strong></p>


<p>Respecting the next class of which the population
consists in our penal colonies,&mdash;that of emancipists, or
persons formerly in bondage as convicts, they appear to
be pretty nearly what might be expected of a body of
men under such circumstances. Although there are many
honourable exceptions to the general rule, yet it would
seem to be a general rule that roguery and industry are
usually connected among them; and that where an
emancipist is less inclined to be dishonest, he is more
inclined to be idle and improvident; while it often
occurs that both faults are found together in one
person. Of course, it would be vain to hope that <em>all</em>
convicts, or even the majority, perhaps, should become
completely reformed; but it is sickening to the heart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
that has any christian feeling, to find descriptions like
the following, given by one amply qualified to judge, of
the deplorable moral and social state of many of those
unhappy men after their time of service has expired.
&ldquo;The newly-arrived convict&rdquo; (Mr. MacArthur states) &ldquo;sees
examples immediately before him of men, formerly in
the same condition with himself, wallowing in licentiousness,
and possessed of wealth, amassed generally by
dishonest means, which they continue, in many instances,
still to augment, by keeping grog-shops and
gambling-houses, by receiving stolen goods, and by
other nefarious practices. This is the general conduct
of the class of emancipated convicts who acquire property,
as well as of some unprincipled adventurers in
the class of free emigrants. There are, however, among
the emancipated convicts of property exceptions from
this prevalent depravity; rare, indeed, and on that
account the more honourable.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> And numberless, in
the earlier history of New South Wales, are the evil
consequences which are recorded to have arisen from
the necessity which then existed of employing either
convicts, or else men recently emancipated, in places of
the highest trust and importance. One striking example
may suffice; and it is believed that no injustice is done
to the class of men now alluded to, when it is stated
that the guilty parties were persons belonging to that
body. Soon after the departure of Governor Hunter,
in 1800, it was discovered that the clerks who were
admitted to the registers of the terms of the transportation
of the convicts, had altered the sentences of nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
200 prisoners, on receiving from each a sum equal in
value to ten or twelve pounds.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Of these examples the
early history of the colony is full; but, in later years,
it may be hoped, that time, and public opinion, and the
tide of emigration, have combined to render the conduct
of persons belonging to this class less generally
objectionable than it formerly was. The greater portion
of the shop-keepers, and what may be called the middling
classes in Sydney, were emancipists; and their wealth
and influence were so great, that, during the years 1834,
1835, and 1836, one-fourth of the jurors who served in
the civil and criminal courts belonged to that body.
These persons are often very little educated; and young
men possessed of from 1000<em>l.</em> to 2000<em>l.</em> a-year in stock,
can sometimes neither read nor write. Cock-fighting,
driving, and badger-baiting, are pursuits that occupy
youths of this class very frequently; and a showy,
tawdry style of dress, engages the attention of the
young women. Certainly, it is not of materials of this
kind, that the English constitution would have juries
composed; and it is not surprising that so large a proportion
of jurors, who have themselves once stood at
the bar of justice, should be the means of carrying
undue partiality for the guilty into the jurors&#8217; box, and
also of keeping out of that responsible station all those
who can in any way escape its duties.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Respectable
men will not, if they can avoid it, sit in the same box
with men who go in with their minds entirely made up
to acquit the guilty, whatever may be the tenor of the
evidence to which they have just been listening, whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the sacredness of the oath they have recently
taken. If practical experience is of any real value,
then it may safely be pronounced that men, who are
scarcely fit to enjoy the privilege of sitting upon juries,
are certainly at present unprepared for the introduction
of a representative form of legislation and government.
The civil juries of New South Wales have held the
scales of justice uncommonly even, for they have
managed to acquit about 50 per cent. of the persons
tried; whereas in Great Britain, and even in Ireland,
the acquittals are 19 per cent., and the convictions
81 per cent. A strange, but not unaccountable difference,
which, so long as it may continue, will furnish a
strong argument of the unfitness of the colony for a
representative assembly. Men that have not the principle
to put good laws into execution, are very ill qualified
to make good laws, or to elect good legislators. And
when, to suit party purposes, a clamour is raised about
the injustice of denying fresh &ldquo;constitutional rights&rdquo;
to our fellow-subjects in Australia, we may quietly dispose
of this (hitherto absurd and mischievous) claim by
referring the very parties raising it to the accounts published,
under the sanction chiefly of men of their own
opinions, respecting the use made of those rights with
which the inhabitants of the penal colonies are already
invested. When the evils of the system of transportation
are to be exposed, the truth may be told respecting the
state of the Australian juries;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> but why should it not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
be still declared,&mdash;why should not truth <em>always</em> be told,&mdash;even
at the hazard of checking &ldquo;liberal principles,&rdquo;
and delaying representative houses of assembly for the
Australian colonies, until the time when they may know
how to use them, so that these may prove a benefit
instead of an evil to them?</p>


<p>Respecting the last and highest class of society in our
penal colonies, the <em>free population</em>, no great deal need be
said in particular, since, except from peculiar circumstances,
they are pretty much the same in character
with the bulk of the population in any other country.
But their peculiar circumstances must, in fairness to the
class last mentioned, be briefly noticed. Undoubtedly,
without any disrespect to emigrants, it may be laid down
as an acknowledged fact, that hitherto this class, though
it has comprised many excellent, clever, and good men,
has not usually been composed of the flower of the
English nation. Supposing that things are now altered
for the better, time was&mdash;and that not many years ago&mdash;when
&ldquo;every one that was in distress, and every one
that was in debt, and every one that was discontented,&rdquo;
was apt to swell the tide of emigration to our British
colonies in Australia. Upon arriving there they found
a regular system of <em>caste</em> established; and since as members
of the <em>free</em> population they were at once exalted to
the highest places, this was a system which in most
cases flattered the pride of the settlers. Possibly many
of the faults of the emancipist class might be traced to
the treatment they have received at the hands of the
free, and these faults react again as causes and excuses
for keeping them at still greater distance than ever.
And however natural, however necessary, a distinction
of ranks is and must be in every society of men, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
nothing can be more unnatural or mischievous than a
system of dividing men into <em>castes</em>. Unhappily, this
division, the fruitful source of all kinds of evil feeling,
has to a great extent prevailed in our penal colonies;
and nothing, it may be boldly asserted, except religion
will ever root it out. Attempt to continue the exclusive
privilege of <em>caste</em> to the free population, and you sow the
seeds of a servile rebellion. Open your hands to give
concessions and privileges to the emancipists, and you
scatter good seed upon the stony rock, you vainly endeavour
to satisfy the daughters of the horse-leech. But
infuse a christian feeling into all classes, get them to
meet in the same church, to kneel at the same table, to
partake in the same spiritual blessings, and then you
may hope that all, whether free or emancipists, will feel
themselves to be members of one another, portions of
the same body, held in union of heart and soul by
means of the same head; &ldquo;for by One Spirit are we all
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to
drink into One Spirit.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>After all that has been stated respecting the three
great classes into which society in Australia is divided,
it need scarcely be added that the taste displayed by
many of the inhabitants of the metropolis of New South
Wales is none of the purest or best. Gay equipages,
dashing horses, tandems, and racers, are among the
favourite exhibitions of the wealth of the emancipist.
For music or paintings but little taste prevails in Sydney,
and for books, except those of a very low and
worthless character, there is no great demand. A fine
house, a fine carriage, fine horses, plenty of spirits to
drink, appear to be thought the chief goods of human
life; and among persons in every class, the acquisition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
of money is the one great object. Indeed this last passion,
the love of gain, can scarcely be mentioned among
the perverted habits by which the Australian colonies
are infested, since it seems scarcely possible that the
worship of Mammon can be practised more openly or
carried much further than it is in the mother country.
Yet the temptations to prefer gain to every thing else
are unusually strong in these settlements. Professions
have been abandoned because they are laborious and
unprofitable, while clergymen, medical gentlemen, soldiers,
government officers, in short, all classes of men,
have made haste to get rich by holding land and stock.
An estate, which originally cost little or nothing, grows
yearly in value, without a penny being spent upon it;
stock speedily increases at very small cost, for there is
abundance of pasture for it; and when the settler finds
these means of gaining wealth opened to him, he is too
apt to devote all his thoughts and energies to this one
object. &ldquo;I have known,&rdquo; says Captain Grey, &ldquo;an
honourable member of council, and leading magistrate
in a colony, take out a retail licence, and add to his
already vast wealth from the profits of a gin-shop.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The evil spirit of covetousness assumes to itself various
shapes and appearances according to varying circumstances;
and among the characters which it calls into
life in Australia, that of a <em>landshark</em> is one of the
most remarkable and hateful. When an emigrant arrives at
Sydney, he is able, perhaps after considerable delay, to
give notice to Government of his wish to purchase some
desirable spot of land, which is then selected to be put
up to auction; and when it has been duly surveyed, the
sale at last takes place. But to the poor emigrant&#8217;s
astonishment and disappointment the land, which he
has chosen so as not to interfere with other property,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
which is unoccupied, and entirely useless both in a public
and private sense,&mdash;is bid for, and finally knocked
down to another at an unreasonable price.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> This other
person is a &ldquo;landshark,&rdquo; who has gained, perchance, a
fortune by regularly attending sales and buying up land
that is known to be desired by another. The &ldquo;shark,&rdquo;
true to his name, wishes either to get his opposition
bought off by a bribe, or else hopes to sell his bargain
at a profit from the unwillingness of his victim to lose
any more time or money in gaining a settlement, with
the risk of meeting, after all, with a second disappointment.
In case of the &ldquo;shark&#8217;s&rdquo; scheme proving unsuccessful,
there is only the small trifle required as earnest
of the purchase to be paid; of course he never completes
the engagement, and in due time, in a year
possibly, the land is declared forfeited to the crown
again. Such is the occupation of a &ldquo;landshark,&rdquo; and it
would be well if these and similar pests of society were
confined, like their namesakes of the ocean, to the more
sultry latitudes, but unfortunately they are not altogether
without their antitypes and imitators in Great Britain.</p>

<p>There is another character, which, if not peculiar
to Australia, is called into being only in those colonies
where a large extent of land in its natural state remains
unappropriated to any individuals. The <em>squatters</em>, as
they are called, are men who occupy with their cattle,
or their habitations, those spots on the confines of a colony
or estate, which have not as yet become any person&#8217;s
private property. By the natural increase of their flocks
and herds, many of these squatters have enriched themselves;
and having been allowed to enjoy the advantages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of as much pasture as they wanted in the bush, without
paying any rent for it to the government, they have
removed elsewhere when the spot was sold, and have
not unfrequently gained enough to purchase that or
some other property. Thus the loneliness, the privations,
and the perils of a pastoral life in the bush, have
often gained at length their recompense, and the squatter
has been converted into a respectable settler. But this
is too bright a picture to form an average specimen
of the class which we are describing. Unfortunately,
many of these squatters have been persons originally of
depraved and lawless habits, and they have made their
residence at the very outskirts of civilization a means of
carrying on all manner of mischief. Or sometimes they
choose spots of waste land near a high road, where the
drays halt to get water for the night, and there the
squatters knock up what is called &ldquo;a hut.&rdquo; In such
places stolen goods are easily disposed of, spirits and
tobacco are procured in return for these at &ldquo;the sly
grog shops,&rdquo; as they are called; and in short they combine
the evils of a gypsy encampment and a lonely
beer-shop in England, only from the scattered population,
the absence of influential inhabitants, and the
deplorably bad characters of the men keeping them,
these spirit shops are worse places than would be
tolerated in this country. It is stated that almost all
the men by whom these resorts of iniquity are kept, are
either ticket-of-leave men or emancipists. It is no easy
thing to suppress these people, for the squatters, like
the black natives, can find a home wherever they betake
themselves. And it must be owned, that considerable
good has resulted in many instances from these forerunners
of civilization having penetrated into a district,
and learned some of its peculiarities and capabilities
before a settlement in it has been regularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
formed. Indeed, it would have been unjust to have
been severe with the poor squatter, and his two or
three sheep and cattle, when it had long been the
practice of the most wealthy landowners in the colony,
to send their stock-man with their hundreds of heads of
cattle into the bush, to find support exactly in the same
way, and without paying anything to government.
The rich proprietors have a great aversion to the class
of squatters, and not unreasonably, yet they are thus,
many of them, squatters themselves, only on a much
larger scale; nor are they more inclined, in many instances,
to pay rent for their privileges than their more
humble brethren. It would appear to be the fairest and
best way of dealing with these various descriptions of
squatters, to endeavour to cut up, root and branch, the
&ldquo;sly grog shops,&rdquo; and road-side gentry, while the owner
of one sheep, or he that possesses 10,000, should be
equally compelled to pay a trifle to government, in proportion
to the number of his stock grazing in the bush,
and should likewise have his location registered. Some
regulations of this kind are, it is believed, proposed, if
they have not by this time been brought into operation;
and thus we may hope, that whatever benefits the system
of <em>squatting</em> may have produced, either as an outlet for
restless spirits, or as a means of extending colonization,
may still be retained, while the numerous evils that
have sprung up along with it may be checked or got rid
of. Respecting one thing connected with this subject,&mdash;the
religious knowledge and spiritual condition of
these inhabitants of the wilderness and their children,
the christian inquirer cannot but feel anxious. The
result of christian anxiety upon this matter cannot be
better stated than in the words of one deeply interested
about it, and well qualified to weigh the subject with all
its bearings. After expressing his thanks to that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Divine Providence, which had enabled him, quite alone,
to travel through many miles of country almost without
cultivation or visible dwellings, the Bishop of Australia
finishes his account of his visitation westward, in the
year 1841, with the following reflections:&mdash;&ldquo;It would be
impossible for any one, without personal observation,
to comprehend from mere description what a field for
future labour is now opening in these as yet uncultivated,
unpeopled tracts which I am continually traversing.
But the time is not far distant when many portions of
them will be thronged with multitudes; and in what
manner those multitudes are to be provided with means
of instruction sufficient to retain them in the christian
faith, I am not able to foresee; as yet, no such provision
is made or promised. But when, in passing through
these scenes, reflections such as these have crowded
upon me, and I am unable to return a satisfactory
answer to the question, &lsquo;How shall this be accomplished?&rsquo;
I can find no better resource than to silence
myself with &lsquo;<em>Deus providebit</em>;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> my trust shall be in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the beings which, although not natives of
the bush, appear to be peculiar to the wilds of Australia,
the class of men called Overlanders must not be
omitted. Their occupation is to convey stock from
market to market, and from one colony to another.
They require, of course, a certain capital to commence
business with, and the courage and skill that are needful
in these enterprises must be very great, so that many
of the overlanders are said to be really men of a superior
class. The love of a roving life, the excitement of
overcoming dangers both from natural causes and from
the fierce attacks of the natives, and the romantic and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
novel situations in which they are frequently placed,
all combine to render some men exceedingly fond of
this occupation, which has also another strong recommendation,
that it is often very profitable. The magnitude
of the adventures thus undertaken would scarcely
be credited, and often a whole fortune is risked in the
shape of cattle driven across the wilderness. One very
important route pursued by the overlanders recently has
been in the same direction with Captain Sturt&#8217;s daring
voyage, namely, from New South Wales to South Australia
by the course of the Murray. An instance is
mentioned by Captain Grey of an overlander who arrived
at Adelaide in March 1840 from Illawarra, and his
stock at the end of his journey is reckoned up, and
found at a moderate computation to be worth no less
than 13,845<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> And during fifteen months, including
the whole of 1839 and part of 1840, there were brought
by the overlanders from New South Wales into South
Australia 11,200 head of horned cattle, 230 horses, and
60,000 sheep, the value of the whole of which amounted
to about 230,800<em>l.</em> Importations of stock immediately
add a value to land, for what is the use of pasture without
animals to feed upon it? And indeed so large an
introduction of those primitive riches, flocks and herds,
is almost sure to give a spur to industry, and to assist
the increasing prosperity of a rising colony. Under the
influence of this cause it is related that land in Western
Australia, which was bought for 23<em>l.</em> an acre in December,
1839, was sold for 60<em>l.</em> an acre in February, 1840.
And in other colonies where overland communication
takes place, instead of the cattle being brought by sea,
as in Western Australia, the effect is yet more astonishing.
There is much that is noble to admire in the character
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
of the overlanders, and their efforts have been
productive of great advantage to our recent colonies;
indeed, it is perhaps in a great measure to their exertions
that the very rapid progress of Port Phillip and
South Australia may be ascribed. But there appears to
be a certain wildness about their character, which, while
it fits them admirably for the pursuit which they have
chosen, renders them restless and uneasy in more quiet
and domestic spheres. The love of gain, too, is rather
more of a ruling passion with them than it ought to be,
but that is a fault by no means peculiar to the overlanders.
Yet it affords a curious comparison and a fresh
proof of our nature being a fallen one, when we come
quietly to contrast the pains taken, the toils endured,
and the risks encountered, in order to supply a colony
with &ldquo;the meat that perisheth,&rdquo; against the indifference,
feebleness, and apathy, which are exhibited about the
spiritual necessities of its inhabitants. Erect the standard
of worldly profit, and thousands will flock to it,
unscared by danger, unwearied by labour. But, meanwhile,
how slow is the banner of the Church in being
unfurled, how few rally around it, when it is displayed;
in short, how much wiser in their generation are the
children of this world than the children of light!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>STATE OF RELIGION AND EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA.</strong></p>


<p>The religious state of the inhabitants of the Australian
colonies, especially of the two oldest and most populous
settlements, has been so frequently the subject of allusion
in this work, that the reader must already have
become acquainted with its general aspect. Nevertheless,
there are many interesting particulars which have
not yet been detailed; and no subject, surely, can concern
more nearly the <em>mother country</em> than the religious
condition of her children and offspring. Upon the mere
surface of things, judging from appearances only, the
religious habits of England would seem perhaps to be
transferred to the Australian colonies no less perfectly
than its social customs; but, although the resemblance
to our spiritual pride and spiritual ignorance, our needless
divisions and contempt of lawful authority, is perfect
enough, except when it occasionally degenerates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
into caricature, yet, in points more deserving of imitation,
the likeness between the mother country and her daughters
is not always so striking. Probably it would be
difficult to sum up the matter better than in the words
of Bishop Broughton, who says, &ldquo;My own opportunities
of observation have been very numerous, and I do
not hesitate to say, that, in either colony, surrounded,
it cannot be dissembled, by much that is base and
disgusting, there is, nevertheless, an extensive, and in
point of actual influence, a preponderating proportion
of integrity and worth, which, if suitably encouraged
and supported now, there may hereafter spring up a
wise and understanding people to occupy this land.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>The way in which the Lord&#8217;s Day is observed in New
South Wales, or Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, may serve for an
index of the general amount of religious feeling among
many of its inhabitants. Sunday desecration,&mdash;despising
the day of rest which the Lord has appointed, is notoriously
one of the first steps which a man is tempted to
take in that downward course of sin which leads him to
the penal colonies; and accordingly, it must be expected
that a large quantity of the old leaven should remain
working in the convict population. And especially was
this to be anticipated, when so little pains were taken to
teach them better things, for the absence of religious
instruction immediately furnishes an excuse for disregard
of the day of rest, and renders that neglect which
was before inexcusable, in some measure unavoidable.
According to Dr. Lang, religion is but seldom taken
into account by the majority of the colonists in their
dealings with their convict-servants. In at least as
many as four cases out of five, he says, that no attention
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
to the day is paid, but frequently it is spent in weighing
out rations, settling accounts, or paying and receiving
visits; while the men, whom it is contrary to law to set
to work on a Sunday, are often allowed to cultivate
ground for themselves, upon the plea that, if they were
not so occupied, they would be doing worse. In the
opinion of Judge Burton, the want of occupation on
the Sunday was a cause of many robberies being
committed, and some of the worst crimes that had
been brought under his notice had taken place upon
that day. Mr. Barnes says, speaking of the men at
the penal settlement of Macquarie Harbour, &ldquo;I believe
more crime or wickedness was committed on Sunday,
when they were ringing the bell for church-service,
than on any other day of the week.&rdquo; These opinions
are confirmed and strengthened by men of various
parties, and different plans have been proposed. That
of increasing the number of churches and of the clergy
is obviously one of the most likely to succeed, but
its success must, in the nature of things, not be very
speedy. It was stated by one witness before the Committee
upon Transportation, that, when the means of
public worship have been provided, the convicts should
be regularly mustered and taken to church, which, he
thinks, would have a good effect; but what is really
wanted is that they should <em>come</em> to church, and not
merely be <em>taken</em> thither. One member of the Committee
inquired whether all the present churches were filled,
and the witness replied that they were not; but this is
rather a proof of the need of additional religious instruction
than an argument against furnishing it. If among
so many souls the few existing places of divine worship
are not all fully occupied, is not this a proof of the
desolate state of the Lord&#8217;s vineyard in that country?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Is not this a sufficient reason for earnestly endeavouring
to increase the number of the labourers in the vineyard?
The heathenism of a considerable portion of a population
nominally christian, manifestly tends to thin the
congregations even of existing churches. But the want
of church extension, and the dearth of ministers, tends
to produce and increase this heathenism, and therefore
it indirectly tends to diminish the numbers of the present
attendants upon divine service. And what a mockery,
in some instances, has the so-called divine service
hitherto been! The director-general of roads in Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land, some years ago, chose to place catechists
and clergy under a ban, though there was no great
risk of his gangs being much troubled by them, when
they had so many other duties to fulfil. And what was
the system which this wise manager of roads chose to
substitute for the teaching of Christ&#8217;s ministers? At
every road-station, daily, morning and evening, readings
of the sacred Scriptures were established, and &ldquo;devotional
exercises&rdquo; were added on the sabbath. Well,
but who officiated? Let Archdeacon Hutchins reply in
the very words used by him, when the matter was
brought before the notice of the government in 1837.
&ldquo;These readings of the Scriptures were performed generally,
if not always, by <em>some of the very worst of the convicts
themselves</em>, selected, no doubt, for the purpose, not on
account of their wickedness, but of their abilities. They
are the best readers, or the cleverest fellows; and therefore,
amongst rogues, generally the greatest. These
are men by whom, as far as the director is concerned, the
seed of religious knowledge is scattered among the road
parties. How far there may be a rational hope of the
Divine blessing accompanying such endeavours, I leave
to be declared by any one possessed of common sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
and some little acquaintance with Scripture.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Even
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, only
&ldquo;made priests of the <em>lowest</em> of the people;&rdquo; he did not,
that we read of, appoint the <em>vilest</em> characters he could
find to that office.</p>

<p>The greater part of the settlers in New South Wales
and Tasmania have been derived from those classes, who,
in England, except in the rural districts, have, until
recently, been well nigh shut out from their parish
churches; and, in many instances, their mode of life here
was little likely to lead them to a regular attendance
upon the public worship of God, even where there was
room for them. But nothing more surely produces
distaste and carelessness in this matter than the total
absence of all regularity respecting it. The truly religious
soul, indeed, when banished by circumstances
from the temple of the Lord, is always inquiring with the
royal Psalmist, &ldquo;When shall I come to appear before
the presence of God?&rdquo; But the careless man, the
worldly-minded man, indeed the greater part of mankind,
it is to be feared, feel no longing desires of this kind.
The further they are removed from the courts of the
Lord&#8217;s house, the less they think about its blessings,
the less concern they take about religion; so that when
an opportunity is offered them of joining in public
worship, it actually is viewed as a trouble instead of a
privilege, and no small pains are taken to escape from
it. For example, it is stated by Mr. Mudie, that when
a clergyman had been able to attend, and divine service
was about to commence, upon his estate, he noticed but
few of the convicts there, the rest declining to come,
upon the plea of their being Roman Catholics. But this
trick was of no avail, for their master, being satisfied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
that they merely wanted to escape attendance, and to
employ the opportunity thus afforded them of prowling
about and thieving, insisted upon all these Romanists
coming up and sitting outside the building in which the
others were assembled. The next time the clergyman
came, they were all Protestants. But in what a wretched
state of depravity must men be who can thus deliberately
tell a lie, in order to avoid joining in the
worship of the Lord their Maker!</p>

<p>To provide for the spiritual wants of our penal
colonies would be, under the most favourable circumstances,
no easy matter; and in the actual condition of
affairs, it is a most difficult and discouraging task. For
not only are the ordinary obstacles arising from man&#8217;s
fallen nature to be surmounted, but the effect of
unusually evil influence and bad example is to be counteracted
in a convict population. And far from opposing
this mischievous spirit by &ldquo;endeavouring to keep the
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,&rdquo; professing
believers are nowhere more at variance than in Australia;
so that the work of turning the hearts of the
disobedient to the wisdom of the Just is perpetually
being disturbed by strife and jealousies among those
who ought to be one, even as Christ and the Father
are One. There, as it has been well observed, &ldquo;the
Church stands upon her own merits, her own divine
right; there all the attested grievances of the Dissenters,
secular and political, are removed; no tithes, no church-rates,
no exclusive state support.&rdquo; And yet there, it
may be added, the fierce contentious spirit which rages
in England is unchanged in character, and the way of
the Church is just as evil spoken of in New South
Wales as in the mother country. The only grievance
the dissenters can complain of now in Australia is that
assistance is afforded to the Church to a larger amount
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
than they would like. But this is grievance enough for
them to raise an outcry about. And hence arise fresh
hindrances to the progress of true religion in these
settlements. There are other spirits besides the unclean
spirits of infidelity and iniquity which the Church has
here to contend against.</p>

<p>The language of a very zealous and active clergyman
of Australia is this:&mdash;&ldquo;Give us clergy and churches,
and I will ensure congregations and a vast spread of the
gospel in the Church of Christ by means of the Church
of England.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> But, so pitiable is the effect of religious
strife, that rather than allow the necessary means to be
given for this purpose, many would be content to leave
things in their present miserable state; and although,
as in the mother country, the majority of the population
belong to the Church of England, yet the minority, in
all its little sections, unite in grudging every effort
that is permitted, every single pound that is spent, by
the government in aid of the Church. There is no
communion that can pretend to lay claim to the religious
instruction of the people; it would be too absurd
to propose that the English nation should entrust the
religious training of a colony, like that of New South
Wales,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> containing upwards of 70,000 persons belonging
to the national Church, into the hands of the Presbyterians,
with their 13,153 souls, or into those of the
Methodists and other dissenters, with their 5,093 souls,
or even to the Romanists, with their 35,690 souls! And
accordingly, since it was hopeless to get this important
and responsible office exclusively for themselves, all
parties really would seem to have conspired together to
keep it, at all events, from falling into the possession of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
that body to which it of right belongs,&mdash;the national
Church of England and Ireland,&mdash;a Church which the
Presbyterians do not generally deny to be scriptural,
and which the Romanists, by their peculiar hostility,
proclaim to be, in the best and oldest meaning of the
word, essentially Protestant. Under feelings of this
description, the Roman Catholics, and their
&ldquo;Presbyterian brethren,&rdquo; (as they can condescend to call
them when it answers their purpose,)<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> have been acting in
Australia for some years past; and, aided by the potent
force of agitation upon a government which &ldquo;cared for
none of these things,&rdquo; except how it might &ldquo;please the
people,&rdquo; they have been successful. Spurning the very
name of toleration, and despairing of exclusive establishments
for their own communion, they have succeeded in
giving birth to a system of joint-establishment for
three communions of Christians, and encouragement and
assistance for as many more as the government may see
fit to patronise. In 1836, the system which now continues
in operation was commenced by Sir R. Bourke,
then Governor of New South Wales, who, in proposing
this plan, expressed a confident hope, (which has never
yet been fulfilled,) that thus people of different persuasions
&ldquo;would be united together in one <em>bond of peace</em>.&rdquo;
It is pitiable to see a fellow-creature, and him, too, a
man in authority, borrowing an expression from a
passage of Holy Scripture, (Eph. iv. 3,) while he is at
the very time forgetting the duty there enforced. The
eye that glances upon the words &ldquo;bond of peace,&rdquo; must
be very careless or very wilful, if those other words,
&ldquo;unity of Spirit,&rdquo; or the words below, in the following
verses of the same chapter, altogether escape its notice.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
The principal features of the new system are these. It
affords assistance in money towards building a church
or chapel, and a dwelling-house for the minister, in all
cases where not less than 300<em>l.</em> have been raised by
private subscriptions. It provides a stipend for the
support of <em>ministers of religion</em>, upon certain conditions,
at the rate of 100<em>l.</em> per annum, where there is a population,
of 100 adult persons, (including convicts,) who
shall subscribe a declaration stating their desire to
attend his place of worship, and shall be living within a
reasonable distance of the same. If 200 adults in similar
circumstances sign the declaration, a stipend of 150<em>l.</em> is
granted; and if 500 persons sign it, the stipend is 200<em>l.</em>&mdash;the
highest amount ever granted towards the support
of any one officiating teacher of religion. In places
where there are less than 100 adults ready to subscribe,
or where there is no church or chapel yet erected, the
governor may contribute a stipend not exceeding 100<em>l.</em>
per annum, but in the latter case 50<em>l.</em> must be promised
also from private sources. A certain proportion of free
sittings, (one-fourth, according to Lang, at least one-sixth
part, according to Burton,) is to be reserved in
each building. Such are the principal points of the
system, and, according to the governor&#8217;s regulations, the
assistance thus offered is limited chiefly to the Church of
England, the Church of Rome, and the Scottish Kirk,
which &ldquo;three grand divisions of Christians&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> are thus
made, in fact, the three established communions of New
South Wales.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly good has resulted from the enactment
of this law in 1836, for before that there were scarcely
any means open of obtaining help towards religious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
instruction, whereas certain means are open now, and
have been very much used. Yet because some good
has resulted in this way, the evil spirit and wretched
tendency of the measure must not be overlooked. All
the good that has resulted might have been obtained
without any of its accompanying evil, if a perfect toleration
had been established, the National Church properly
endowed, and a sufficient supply of Roman Catholic
priests or Presbyterian teachers for the convict population
of those persuasions liberally supported by government,
as in the gaols in Ireland. In this case, the poor
convict, who is not permitted to possess money, would
have had the consolations of religion, however imperfect,
offered to him in his own way, while the free settler
would have had the doors of the national Church opened
to him, or the liberty, in case of his dissenting from that,
of providing for himself a separate conventicle. Where
would have been the hardship of this arrangement?
Or why should the <em>voluntary system</em>, which is, in the
northern hemisphere, so highly extolled by many Irish
Romanists and not a few Presbyterians, in the southern,
be thought a punishment and degradation? Thus, &ldquo;not
only has equal protection,&mdash;for God forbid that we
should ever repine at equal protection,&mdash;but equal
encouragement been given by government to every
description of religious faith, and every denomination
of professing Christians, in some of the most important
dependencies of the British crown.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Is not this, it
may be asked, the very course which a mild and tolerant
<em>heathen</em> government would pursue? And is the same
policy, which would probably be followed by heathen
rulers, either right or expedient in rulers professing
themselves to be Christians?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
Certainly, whatever other arrangements might have
been adopted, those that have been made are faulty in
principle; and this is true, although it be confessed that
some good has arisen from them, since through them an
increased supply of religious teaching has been afforded
to the colonists, however reluctantly wrung from the
government in behalf of the Church of England. The
faultiness of principle in these arrangements is thus
stated by the present Bishop of Australia, a man well
fitted to the responsible station which he fills in Christ&#8217;s
Church. &ldquo;By the government plan of aid,&rdquo; he observes,
&ldquo;encouragement is given to the lax and dangerous
opinion, that there is in religion nothing that is either
certain or true. The government virtually admits that
there is no divinely-instituted form of church-membership,
or of doctrine, otherwise that one would in preference
receive its support. The consequence is that the
most awful truths of Christianity, which have been
acknowledged and preserved in the Church from the
beginning, are now frequently spoken of as merely
sectarian opinions, to which no peculiar respect is due.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
The Roman Catholics hailed this measure with delight,
for what to them can be a greater triumph or a more
gratifying spectacle than to behold a great Protestant
nation, inquiring, as Pilate did, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; The
Presbyterians, likewise, and Protestant Dissenters, were
not behind their brethren of Rome (though there were
fewer voices to join the shout) in greeting so exquisitely
liberal a measure, which is actually founded upon some
of their favourite notions respecting the harmlessness
of divisions, the total invisibility of the Church, and the
hatefulness of &ldquo;a dominant episcopacy.&rdquo; The rejoicings
which were to be heard in quarters apparently so opposite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
boded no good from the measure to the Church of
England; and, certainly, from the strange way in which
this law has been carried into operation, so far as that
communion is concerned, the Government are not to be
thanked for any favourable results that have followed.
Through the activity of the members of our Church,
both at home and in Australia, an increased supply of
churches and of clergy has indeed been obtained; but
this has, in most instances, literally been wrung from
the ruling powers; while the only boon that was freely
given,&mdash;a most valuable boon, it is willingly acknowledged,&mdash;was
the appointment of a bishop instead of an
archdeacon. However, the value of the boon thus
obtained was lessened by the disregard shown by
Government to the wants of the Church in Australia.
The Bishop returned from England, after his consecration
in 1836, <em>alone, without being accompanied by a single
clergyman</em>, because, while Roman Catholic priests and
Presbyterian teachers were still eligible to receive, and
did receive, the aid of government, the Church of England
was to remain as it was, notwithstanding its pressing
wants and increasing numbers. All allowances towards
the expense of the passage, or residence, or means of
support for any additional clergymen, were refused.
During five years, from 1832 to 1836, the number of
chaplains continued to be the same, except in 1833,
when there were only fifteen instead of sixteen in the
estimates; and this was not because no increase was
needful,&mdash;for when an outfit of 150<em>l.</em>, and a yearly salary
of 50<em>l.</em> were generously furnished to twenty clergymen
by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in
consequence of the extreme necessity of the case, every
one of these were instantly employed. A subscription,
amounting to 3,000<em>l.</em> was at this time raised in England
in behalf of the Church in Australia, and when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Government perceived that public opinion was awakened
in its favour, and that they had succeeded in giving their
friends and supporters a tolerably good start, they at
length agreed, with the tact peculiar to them, to place
the Church of England (at least nominally) upon the
same footing with the two other &ldquo;grand divisions of Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, therefore, the same assistance in outfit, and the
same amount of salary proportioned to the numbers of
the congregation, are awarded, according to the Act, to
the teachers of each of these three divisions. And
thus, as Sir R. Bourke informs Lord Glenelg, in 1837,
ministers of the Church of England have been forthcoming
to &ldquo;answer (in many instances) the calls of congregations
of their communion;&rdquo; while, as a matter of
course, where no call is heard, no answer is attempted
to be given. How very opposite is this modern idea of
<em>the sheep calling the shepherd to them</em>, from that pattern
set before us by the good Shepherd, who &ldquo;came to seek
and to save that which was lost!&rdquo; But still, though
nominally upon an equality with the others, it is distressing
to find how hard a measure has been dealt to
the Church in New South Wales; how studiously every
petty advantage that could be taken has been taken of
it by a Government calling itself liberal and impartial.
A few instances of this shall be given, which may serve
to show how our brethren in the colonies have been
treated, and how we should ourselves be treated, if dissent
and Romanism could get the upper-hand in our
native country; for then, at the very best, the clergy
would be placed, as they now are in Australia, &ldquo;in a state
of dependence upon two unstable supports;&mdash;the will
of Government, and the disposition of the people.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> At
present, the latter is favourable enough in Australia;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
but the good-will of the Government towards the Church
has been indeed strangely shown within the last few
years. When the other communions and persuasions
in the colony had nearly, if not altogether, provided
themselves with the number of ministers that the law
would allow them, while the wants of the Church
remained, to a great extent, unsupplied, advantage was
taken of an expression in a letter of the governor, Sir
George Gipps,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and a limitation was imposed upon the
government assistance by Lord Normanby, which operated
exclusively to the hurt of the Church of England.
In a like spirit it was that the governor of New South
Wales refused to consider as private contributions for
schools either sums granted by the societies in England,
or by their diocesan committee in New South Wales;
although, in both instances, the money was raised entirely
by private subscription. The inconvenience, delay, and
disappointment which this one arbitrary rule occasioned
were astonishing; and to those who took delight in
balking the efforts and thwarting the good works of our
Church, it must have been very gratifying. So, too,
must the refusal, in 1841, of a piece of land for a site of
a church and parsonage in the wild district on the banks
of the Morrumbidgee, containing 1,200 souls, dispersed
about over a very extensive range of country.</p>

<p>Another example of similar conduct has occurred since
the change of ministry at home, which would, it might
have been hoped, have infused a better feeling into the
colonial authorities. At the end of 1841, the Bishop
proposed to erect, in certain spots, small wooden
churches, as the only means of obtaining churches at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
all; trusting, that after these had stood forty or fifty
years, they might be replaced by buildings of a higher
and more lasting character. The average cost of these
humble little buildings was to be from 100<em>l.</em> to 120<em>l.</em>;
and they were intended for very poor districts; but since
the outlay did not amount to 300<em>l.</em>, the Government would
give nothing, and no effort was made to introduce a
modification of the law (supposing that to have been
needful) in order to meet such cases. Instances to the
same effect might easily be multiplied. In New South
Wales land is comparatively cheap, and a horse is an
indispensable necessary for a clergyman; but no part of
the government grant is allowed to be spent in purchasing
more than an acre for the site of a church, and half
an acre for a house and garden. &ldquo;To extend the latter
allowance to any quantity of land from which an income
might be derived, would increase the emoluments of the
minister, at the public expense, beyond what the Act
contemplates;&rdquo; so the Bishop of Australia was assured
by official authority in 1836. But enough of these
miserable instances of state-peddling in ecclesiastical
establishments. &ldquo;There is no semblance,&rdquo; to use Mr.
Gladstone&#8217;s words, &ldquo;in any part of these arrangements,
of a true and sound conception of the conscientious
functions of government in matters of religion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> May
we venture to hope that the present ministry, of which
the writer of the above is a distinguished member, may
exhibit in their conduct and arrangements, both in the
colonies and at home, a more sound and true conception
of their duty than was ever shown by their predecessors?
Such hopes, undoubtedly, are entertained by a portion
of the British public, not unimportant either in numbers
or in moral and political influence. Nevertheless, the
zealously attached members of the Church of England
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
need not to be reminded of a truth which is frequently
brought before them in the circle of its daily service.
They know that &ldquo;it is better to trust in the Lord than
to put any confidence in princes.&rdquo; They are sure that,
if theirs is a living branch of Christ&#8217;s Holy Catholic
Church, many a weapon will be formed against it, but
yet &ldquo;no weapon that is formed against it shall prosper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be wearying to the reader to attempt to enter
into the same details respecting schools as have been
stated with regard to churches. The fate of the Church
and School Corporation has elsewhere been related.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
Suffice it to say, then, that the same spirit of hostility
or indifference has been equally exhibited in both cases;
indeed, it would be strange if the bitter enemies, and
feeble or false friends of that system of religious instruction
which is carried on among the adult population by
our national Church, were not alike vigorous in their
opposition, or impotent in their friendship, to the
system of religious training among the infant population
which is wrought out by our national schools. However,
in mentioning the subject of schools, the unsuccessful
attempt of the Government, in 1836, to saddle
the colony of New South Wales with schools conducted
upon the modern Irish system, must not be left
unnoticed. On this occasion, it may be observed, the
Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist, and Wesleyan
&ldquo;denominations of Christians,&rdquo; were actually forced
to leave, for a while, their liberal friends and allies of the
Church of Rome, and to seek the assistance, and rejoice
in the strength of the &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; and &ldquo;dominant&rdquo;
Church of England. It is really curious to observe
these various sects seeking out the Bishop of Australia,
and requesting him to preside at their meeting in opposition
to the proposed measure; and since, although he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
disagreed with them in a matter not then at issue,
namely, the need of creeds and catechisms in imparting
religious instruction, nevertheless, as he agreed entirely
with them in the matter which was at issue,&mdash;the propriety
and necessity of using the Holy Scriptures in
religious teaching,&mdash;he complied with their request,
presided at their meeting, and signed their petition.
He also presented a petition from himself on the same
subject; for the Government had so contrived to shuffle
between the Archdeacon and the Bishop, that Dr.
Broughton, who had very recently been consecrated,
could, just at the time when the education scheme was
to have passed, claim a seat in the legislative council in
neither capacity. It so happened, that by an official
neglect at the Colonial-office in London, no patent, including
the Bishop as a member, had been forwarded to
New South Wales; so when he reached Sydney, he
found himself excluded from his seat in the council
during the whole time in which this matter was under
discussion there. The plan appeared to be successful;
3,000<em>l.</em> was devoted towards establishing the new scheme,
and an honoured name, that of &ldquo;National Schools,&rdquo; was
pilfered, and bestowed upon those that were projected in
Sydney. But, in this instance, high principle and popular
feeling were united against the Irish scheme; and as it
began with a blunder at the Colonial-office, so it proved
to be little better than a blunder throughout. The
schools proposed were never established; and since
that time the Roman Catholics have made a different
sort of attempt to gain educational power, by obtaining
separate sums for their own schools, and swamping the
members of the Church of England, under the honourable
but much abused appellation of Protestants, in the
general quagmire of heresy and schism. However, this
second effort, which was made with the sanction of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Government, was defeated chiefly (under Providence)
by the zeal and ability of the Bishop; and whoever is
desirous of seeing a noble specimen of clear reasoning
and manly eloquence, will be gratified and improved by
reading the Bishop of Australia&#8217;s speech upon the occasion
of this scheme having been proposed by Sir George
Gipps in the legislative council. Certainly, when we
consider how admirably Bishop Broughton demolished
Sir George Gipps&#8217;s scheme, we must own that the tact
was very acute,&mdash;or at least the <em>mistake</em> rather
<em>suspicious</em>,&mdash;which shut him out of the legislative
council when Governor Bourke&#8217;s plan was in agitation.</p>

<p>Besides the schools assisted by Government for the
education of the lower orders, there are, of course, many
private schools in the Australian colonies; and it is believed
that these important establishments are no longer
so commonly under the direction of men that have been
convicts as they formerly were. Undoubtedly, one who
has been transported <em>may</em>, perchance, turn out afterwards
to be a good instructor of youth, but what christian
parent would willingly risk his child&#8217;s religious and
moral progress upon a chance, a possibility, of this
kind? The King&#8217;s School at Paramatta is an excellent
establishment, founded and conducted upon the principles
of the Church of England. Sydney College is another
well-conducted school, but its principles are more
open to objection. &ldquo;It is to be believed,&rdquo; as has been
remarked, &ldquo;that a desire to gain the support of men of
all religious principles, led to the Sydney College being
founded on none;&rdquo; and it was scarcely possible to fall
into a greater error than that of passing almost unnoticed
the one thing needful. It is true, that prayers are
used daily in this school, and there seems, from Judge
Burton&#8217;s account of it, to be much that is good and
praiseworthy in its management and details. But a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
school where the children of Protestants, Roman Catholics,
and Jews, meet together, must be, at best, an odd
jumble; and the religious tendency of such an education
must be very questionable.</p>

<p>The Australian College is said by Dr. Lang, its
founder, to be the most promising establishment in New
South Wales, being more likely to resemble in course of
time a small university or college in Europe than the
others are. It is chiefly in the hands of the Presbyterians,
and appears to be a thriving and well-conducted school of
general learning. Religious instruction is not neglected,
but all this department of education is arranged in a
vague and general way, so as to avoid as much as possible
disputed points; and if parents or guardians object
to children receiving this kind of instruction at all, these
pupils are allowed to withdraw at the times when it is
given. If no essential points of Christianity had ever
been brought into dispute, it might have been wise to
avoid those unessential points that had been; or if religion
were a matter of indifference or secondary consequence,
then it might be well to provide for pupils
withdrawing beyond the reach of its voice. But since
neither of these suppositions are true, the system of the
Australian College cannot be recommended. It may be
very <em>liberal</em>. It is not very <em>wise</em>. But it is hard
to say when we have reached the extremity of any opinions.
The plan of the Australian College is far too narrow and
confined for some choice spirits of New South Wales;
and accordingly the Normal Institution, as it is pompously
designated, has been formed by a seceder from
the first-named establishment. It is said to be tolerably
flourishing, and no wonder, for it offers a very fair <em>secular</em>
education, and this is sufficient for the children of this
world,&mdash;unhappily, no insignificant or small class either
in New South Wales or elsewhere. But the christian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
reader will be satisfied of the sandy foundation on which
the Normal Institution is raised, when he glances over
the following extracts from its original prospectus. The
pupils are to be afforded &ldquo;every facility and abundant
materials for forming opinions of their own,&rdquo;&mdash;young
children, instead of being brought to Christ, are to be
allowed (if they can) to find their way to Him. The
prospectus says, &ldquo;Till the mind has formed religious
opinions of its own, grounded on a wide range of religious
knowledge, the profession of religion is meaningless,
if not incalculably pernicious.&rdquo; Our Lord&#8217;s words
are, &ldquo;Except ye be converted and become as little children,
ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;
But it is vain to quote the words of Scripture to men
who will make professions like this: &ldquo;To inculcate any
given set of religious tenets, or to teach any given set
of religious text-books, would be to lend my labours to
a party whilst I profess to labour for mankind.&rdquo; As
though, forsooth, we could ever labour more advantageously
for mankind than when we try to persuade
them, from their very tenderest years, to believe in the
Bible and to belong to the church of God!</p>

<p>It is the expressed opinion of the highest authority
in the church of Australia, that New South Wales, which
is certainly the farthest advanced of all our colonies
there, is not yet ripe for the establishment of a regular
college, resembling our ancient and venerated English
universities. But this most important object has not
been lost sight of; and while a grammar-school has
recently been opened in St. James&#8217;s parish in Sydney,
and another is projected at Newcastle, both of which
are intended to form a nursery for the future college,
the means of providing this last are beginning to
accumulate. Mr. Thomas Moore, of Liverpool, in New South
Wales, who died in 1840, has left the site of his house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
in Liverpool, with ground adjoining, together with 700
acres of land, in trust towards the establishment of a
college in immediate and exclusive connexion with the
Church of England and Ireland. This bequest, in itself
insufficient for the proposed purpose, will yet serve for
a foundation to begin upon; 3,000<em>l.</em> were voted in January,
1840, by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
to advance the same good object, and it is expected
that the fund will increase and gather strength
before the time shall have arrived when it will be thought
advisable to commence the college. A new school, attached
to the Church of England, is also about to be
begun in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land. It is to be called Archdeacon
Hutchins&#8217;s school, being intended by its promoters
for a lasting and useful memorial of their respect
for the late lamented Archdeacon of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land.
In the last published account of this undertaking, it is
stated that about 850<em>l.</em> was subscribed for this purpose,
but at least 2,000<em>l.</em> will be wanted. Our noble Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge, ever active in
advancing the glorious purpose for which it was formed,
has contributed 100<em>l.</em> towards this school, which is to
be built at Hobart Town. And it may be observed, that
henceforth Van Diemen&#8217;s Land will demand even more
spiritual care and assistance than the elder colony; for
by recent arrangements, the transportation of criminals
to New South Wales has altogether ceased, and Van
Diemen&#8217;s Land is now the only colony to which convicts
are conveyed.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>A census of the population of New South Wales was
taken on the 2d of March, in the year 1841, and the
general result of this is here added for the satisfaction
of the reader. In the whole colony, including its various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
dependencies, but exclusive of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
the total of inhabitants was 130,856, of which number
43,558 were females, and 87,298 males, being as nearly
as possible two to one in favour of the latter. The
number of houses, mostly built of wood, was 16,776,
nearly in the proportion of eight inhabitants to each
house. The return of the various religious persuasions
was as follows:&mdash;Church of England, 73,727, forming a
clear majority upon the whole population. Scotch Kirk,
13,153, forming about a tenth of the whole amount of
the inhabitants of New South Wales. Members of the
Church of Rome, 35,690, being rather more than one-fourth
of the population. Protestant Dissenters, including
Wesleyans, 5,093, making about one-twenty-sixth
of the whole. Jews, 856, Mahometans and Pagans, 207.
Of the inhabitants of New South Wales in 1841, 101,749
were returned as free, while 26,977 were in bondage.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
In 1836, there was about one and three-quarters free to
one bond, while in 1841, there were four free to one
bond, the proportion of free to the whole population
having gained sixteen per cent. in the five years.
Henceforth, from the natural increase by births, from
the influx of emigrants, and the stoppage of transportation,
the advance will be much more rapid. The
population of Sydney was, in 1841, no less than 29,973
souls; of these, 16,505 were returned as members of the
Church of England; 8,126 belonged to the Romish
Church; 3,111 were members of the Scotch Kirk;
1,707 were Protestant Dissenters; 462 were Jews; and
62 Mahometans and Pagans. It will be seen, that in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
population of the metropolis of the colony, the proportions
of the various religious opinions are not very
materially different from those in the whole of New
South Wales, except that the number of Roman Catholics
and Dissenters are greater, as they usually are in large
towns, and that in Sydney the Romanists have increased,
whilst in the colony generally they have diminished since
the last census.</p>

<p>A few words may not be out of place, in a work
descriptive of the Australian colonies, upon the subject
of emigration, but so much has been written upon this
matter, that a very few words may suffice to give the
opinions of those who are practically acquainted with
the subject. Undoubtedly, active, industrious, and
prudent persons, are likely to prosper in Australia to a
degree which is impossible, and scarcely credible, in
Great Britain. No doubt, Providence has in these, and
in our other colonies, given England a means of letting
its surplus population escape in a way that shall not be
merely safe, but even profitable, to the mother country,
as well as to the emigrants themselves. The average
consumption of English manufactures by the Australian
colonists, has recently been stated to amount to ten
guineas a-head, while that of the inhabitants of the
European countries is only two shillings.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> And what
true-born Englishman would refuse to rejoice in the
increased demand thus likely to be opened for our
manufactures, and in the increased prosperity of our
fellow-subjects on the other side of the globe, who
are thus enabled to supply their own wants, by purchasing
English goods? The objections which we hear
occasionally urged against emigration amount, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
one important exception, to little or nothing. The
distance and long voyage, the risk of not succeeding,
the impossibility now of pig-drivers and convicts
becoming masters of many thousands a-year,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> the
paramount necessity of patient industry and prudent
forecast in Australia, no less than in the rest of the
world,&mdash;all these circumstances offer no reasonable
hindrance to the emigrant&#8217;s attempt, either to better his
condition, or else to get that daily bread which in
England he finds difficult to be obtained. And, whatever
obstacles of this kind may at first deter him, the careful
settler will soon find himself victorious over these, and
more comfortably situated, in a worldly sense, than he
ever before was.</p>

<p><em>In a worldly sense</em>, it is said, because, unhappily, there
is one great objection to all emigration, belonging to it
of necessity, which, in the English colonies, and not least
so in Australia, has been fearfully increased and needlessly
aggravated. The want of religious instruction in newly-peopled
countries, and among a widely-scattered and pastoral population,
must needs be grievous, even under the most favourable
circumstances. And if these countries are used as penal
settlements, the want is likely to be still more deplorable.
But the evil is inflamed to the utmost degree,
when, as in Australia during the earlier years of its
colonial history, little provision of any kind is made for
the spiritual need of the people, or when, as in the
same country in later years, &ldquo;a system is pursued
which would seem to indicate an utter indifference on
the part of those who dispense the national treasure,
whether truth or falsehood shall characterise the religious
creeds of any of the colonists.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> And thus, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the sum total of religious provision is very insufficient,
that little is divided in a kind of scramble among various
parties, so that Irish Roman Catholics, who cry up the
voluntary system at home, are tempted to glory in
being one of &ldquo;the three established communions&rdquo; in
New South Wales; and Scotch Presbyterians, who profess
extreme ardour for the American system of &ldquo;leaving
every religious denomination to support its own
ministers,&rdquo; find in Australia assistance from Government
(or even from a clergyman of the Church of England)<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
very convenient, and &ldquo;a&#8217; vera weel,&rdquo; as the
cannie Scots say. With so much irreligion, so small
and so miserably divided a power to oppose it, as we
behold in Australia, the great question with every one
proposing to emigrate is, whether he can take that step
without probable spiritual loss; and at this price he
would find all worldly gain too dearly bought. There
are many places in our colonies, it is true, where a person
may use (or, if he pleases, neglect) the means of
grace, exactly as at home; and against these spots the
objection now urged would not at all weigh. But
before any one removes himself into the wilderness, or
far away from any place of worship, except the chapel
of the Roman Catholic or the meeting of the separatist,
he should be well rooted and grounded in the faith of
his fathers. And supposing him to be so, what real
patriot could wish a man of this kind to emigrate! How
ill can England spare out of any rank of life such persons
as these! Before emigration can become as general
and respectable as it ought to be, <em>religion</em> must be
made its groundwork; and religion, to be successful in
doing the work of Christ in the hearts of men, must not
consist in that modern jumble of denominations, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
pretends to the name, but must teach its doctrines by
means of the ministrations of the &ldquo;Church of the Living
God,&rdquo; which is the pillar and ground of the truth.
When this foundation has been laid, then can the
conscientious churchman zealously promote emigration, and
not before. And if it should never be laid, still, whatever
may be his fears for weak brethren, or his value for
more steadfast fellow-members of Christ, influencing him
to avoid the responsibility of advising them to quit the
home of their fathers, the faithful churchman will be
under no alarm whatever, respecting the stability of the
branch planted by his mother-church in Australia. Nor
yet will he grudge all other denominations (unless they
be blasphemous or immoral,) the most complete toleration.
Nay, were it not for the mischief that would arise
to Christianity and to the souls of men, they might be
welcome to all the support and patronage of the State;
and if they obtain it all, even then we fear them not;
indeed it is our duty to pity them, to love them, to pray
for them as brethren. Whatever may be the fate either
of Australia or England, the lot of Christ&#8217;s Church&mdash;that
visible Church of His which was founded upon the
first preaching of Peter both to the Jews and to the
Gentiles&mdash;is fixed and determined:&mdash;it is firmly built
upon a rock, and &ldquo;the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Volume contains the Ancient Music, as adapted to the First Prayer
Book of Edward VI., by <span class="smcap">John Marbecke</span>, together with the
Litany Chant, and other portions of Gregorian Music not included in
his work; thus forming a complete Choral Book for the Service of the
English Church. An explanatory Introduction by the Editor is prefixed.</p>

<p><span class="tbhigh">*&nbsp;</span><span class="tblow">*</span><span class="tbhigh">&nbsp;*</span>
This Psalter, which completes this unique work, is now nearly ready.
Along with this will be given the Burial Service as noted by Marbecke,
together with an APPENDIX, containing the Benedictus, Post Communion
Sentences, and other portions of ancient music, as contained in his
book. The work will thus comprise all the music of Marbecke&#8217;s publication,
(which was adapted to the first Prayer-Book of Edward VI.) and will
likewise be a complete edition of the present Anglican Service.
Independently of the interest attached to the musical part of the work,
it will be found an elegant service book, adapted either for private
use, or for the Church desk or altar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether we regard the importance of the subjects upon which it bears,
or the intrinsic beauty of the volume itself, we do not know whether we
have been ever more pleased with a modern publication. It is most
sumptuously printed in black letter, and rubricated, not only with those
portions which are usually understood by that name, but with titles,
initials, ornaments, and the Gregorian staff of four lines: every page
is surrounded with arabesques, executed from blocks, which, by an
ingenious combination, are much diversified; and in the large paper
copies, we would willingly borrow some of Dr. Dibdin&#8217;s hyperbole to
express our admiration. But the view under which we hail the present
publication, is the impetus which we trust that it will give to the
study of the true ecclesiastical <em>plain chant.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;<em>English
Churchman.</em></p>

The verses are easy, and, though rather in the ballad style, are free

severe and simple effect of old painted windows.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>British Critic.</em></p>

See Dr. Ullathorne&#8217;s Reply to Burton, especially at p. 5,
where it appears that the judge was not quite impartial in one
of his statements. Dr. Ullathorne himself has, in his 98
pages, contrived to crowd in at least twice as many misrepresentations
as Burton&#8217;s 321 pages contain. But that is no
excuse. The Romish Church may need, or seem to need,
such support. The cause defended by Judge Burton needs
it not.</p></div>

An expedient used by the natives in Torres Strait, on the
northern coast of Australia, for getting water, may here be noticed,
both for its simplicity and cleverness. &ldquo;Long slips of bark are tied
round the smooth stems of a tree called the <em>pandanus</em>, and the
loose ends are led into the shells of a huge sort of cockle, which
are placed beneath. By these slips the rain which runs down the
branches and stem of the tree is conducted into the shells, each of
which will contain two or three pints; thus, forty or fifty placed
under different trees will supply a good number of men.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flinders&#8217;</span>
<em>Voyage to Terra Australis</em>, vol. ii. p. 114.</p>

<p>A different plan for improving the water that is hot and muddy, is
thus detailed by Major Mitchell. To obtain a cool and clean draught
the blacks scratched a hole in the soft sand beside the pool, thus
making a filter, in which the water rose cooled, but muddy. Some
tufts of long grass were then thrown in, through which they sucked
the cooler water, purified from the sand or gravel. I was glad to
follow their example, and found the sweet fragrance of the grass
an agreeable addition to the luxury of drinking.</p></div>

The artless description of this sad discovery, given by
one of the natives who accompanied the party, may be not unworthy of
the reader&#8217;s notice. &ldquo;Away we go, away, away, along the shore away,
away, away, a long distance we go. I see Mr. Smith&#8217;s footsteps
ascending a sand-hill, onwards I go regarding his footsteps. I see
Mr. Smith dead. We commence digging the earth. Two <em>sleeps</em> had
he been dead; greatly did I weep, and much I grieved. In his blanket
folding him, we scraped away the earth. We scrape earth into the grave,
we scrape the earth into the grave, a little wood we place in it. Much
earth we heap upon it&mdash;much earth we throw up. No dogs can dig there,
so much earth we throw up. The sun had just inclined to the westward
as we laid him in the ground.&ldquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Grey&#8217;s</span> <em>Travels in Western

Mr. Cunningham, in Mitchell&#8217;s Three Expeditions, vol. i. p. 180,
<em>et seq.</em> How thrilling must have been the recollections of his
fellow-travellers in the wilderness at the simple incident thus
related: &ldquo;In the bed of the river, where I went this evening to enjoy
the sight of the famished cattle drinking, I came accidentally on an
old footstep of Mr. Cunningham in the clay, now baked hard by the sun.
Four months had elapsed, and up to this time the clay bore the last
records of our late fellow-traveller.&rdquo;</p></div>

&ldquo;A cluster of these trees would be an excellent
beacon to warn mariners of their danger when near a coral reef, and
at all events their fruit would afford some wholesome nourishment to
the ship-wrecked seamen. The navigator who should distribute 10,000
cocoa-nuts amongst the numerous sand banks of the great ocean and
Indian Sea, would be entitled to the gratitude of all maritime nations,
and of every friend of humanity.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flinders&#8217;</span> <em>Voyage to

Although the basin of this river extends so far towards
the east, on its westerly bank, that is, <em>towards the interior</em>,
a desert country stretches itself to an unknown distance, from which
it does not appear to receive any increase of its waters at all
deserving of notice. From two hills, seventy miles apart, extensive
views were gained of this western desert, in which no smoke was seen,
indicating the presence of natives, nor even any appearance of trees;
the whole country being covered with a thick bush or scrub. For the
four winter months spent by Mitchell near the Darling, neither
rain nor yet dew fell, and the winds from the west and north-west,
hot and parching, seemed to blow over a region in which no humidity
remained.</p></div>

By <em>dry season</em>, or <em>wet season</em>, in Australia,
we are not to understand, as in England, a <em>dry</em> or
<em>wet summer</em>, but a series of <em>dry</em> or <em>wet years</em>. At
the very bottom of some of the dried-up lakes were found sapling trees
of ten years&#8217; growth, which had evidently been killed by the return
of the waters to their long-forsaken bed.</p></div>

Water is proverbially &ldquo;unstable,&rdquo; but what occurred to
Major Mitchell&#8217;s party on the Yarrayne, may serve for a specimen of the
peculiar uncertainty of the waters of Australia. In the evening a bridge
across that stream had been completed, and everything was prepared for
crossing it, but in the morning of the following day no bridge was to be
seen, the river having risen so much during the night, although no rain
had fallen, that the bridge was four feet under water, and at noon the
water had risen fourteen feet,&mdash;a change that could only be accounted for
by the supposed melting of the snow near the sources of the stream.</p></div>

Another lake, called Walljeers, at no very great distance
from this, was found, with its whole expanse of about four miles in
circumference, entirely covered with a sweet and fragrant plant,
somewhat like clover, and eaten by the natives. Exactly resembling
new-made hay in the perfume which it gives out even when in the
freshest state of verdure, it was indeed &ldquo;sweet to sense and lovely
to the eye&rdquo; in the heart of a desert country.</p></div>

One crime, in which the inhabitants of the neighbouring
islands of New Zealand notoriously indulge, has been charged also upon
the people of New Holland; but, since no mention of their
<em>cannibalism</em> is made by those British travellers who have seen
most of the habits of the natives, it is hoped that the charge is an
unfounded one. See, however, M. Martin&#8217;s New South Wales, pp. 151-2,
and the instance of <em>Gome Boak</em>, in Collins&#8217; History of New South
Wales, p. 285; and Sturt&#8217;s Expeditions in Australia, vol. ii. p. 222.</p></div>

Nay, our fellow-countrymen in the Australian colonies,
can, by no means, endure a strict trial, even by their own rule of
right. Take, for instance, the following very common case:&mdash;The kangaroo
disappears from cattle-runs, and is also killed by stockmen, merely for
the sake of the skin; but no mercy is shown to the natives who may help
themselves to a bullock or a sheep. They do not, it is true, breed and

Speaking of a tribe which he found upon the banks of the
Darling, Mitchell says, &ldquo;The men retained all their front teeth, and
had no scarifications on their bodies, two most unfashionable
peculiarities among the aborigines.&rdquo; (<span class="smcap">Mitchell&#8217;s</span> <em>Three
Expeditions</em>, vol. i. p. 261.) The same intelligent traveller
accounts for the custom of knocking out the teeth, by supposing it a
typical sacrifice, probably derived from early sacrificial rites. The
cutting off the last joint of the little finger of females, (he adds,)
seems a custom of the same kind. It is a curious observation, that the
more ferocious among the natives on the Darling were those tribes that
had <em>not</em> lost their front teeth.&mdash;Vol. ii. p. 345, and
vol. i. p. 304.</p></div>

A less serious but even more effectual method of dispersing
the natives, when they became troublesome, and would not quit the
settlers&#8217; camp at night, is mentioned by Mitchell. At a given signal,
one of the Englishmen suddenly sallied forth wearing a gilt mask, and
holding in his hand a blue light with which he fired a rocket. Two men
concealed bellowed hideously through speaking-trumpets, while all the
others shouted and discharged their fire-arms into the air. The man in
the mask marched solemnly towards the astonished natives, who were seen
through the gloom but for an instant, as they made their escape and
disappeared for ever.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mitchell&#8217;s</span>

On a similar occasion, near the Darling, where the
inhabitants are remarkable for their thievish habits, when a crow was
shot, in order to scare them by its sudden death, the only result was,
that, before the bird had reached the ground, one of them rushed forward

The kiley, or boomerang, is a thin curved missile, which
can be thrown by a skilful hand so as to rise upon the air, and its
crooked course may be, nevertheless, under control. It is about two feet
four inches in length, and nine and a half ounces in weight. One side,
the uppermost in throwing, is slightly convex, the lower side is flat. It
is amazing to witness the feats a native will perform with this weapon,
sometimes hurling it to astonishing heights and distances, from which,
however, it returns to fall beside him; and sometimes allowing it to fall
upon the earth, but so as to rebound, and leap, perhaps, over a tree, or
strike some object behind.</p></div>

For instance, the natives on the river Bogan used the new
tomahawks, given them by Major Mitchell, in getting wild honey&mdash;a food
very commonly eaten in Australia&mdash;from the hollow branches of the trees.
It seemed as though, in the proper season, they could find it almost
everywhere. &ldquo;To such inexpert clowns as they probably thought us,&rdquo;
continues the Major, &ldquo;the honey and the bees were inaccessible, and
indeed, invisible, save only when the natives cut the former out, and
brought it to us in little sheets of bark; thus displaying a degree of
ingenuity and skill in supplying wants, which we, with all our science,
could not hope to attain.&rdquo; They caught a bee, and stuck to it, with gum
or resin, some light down of a swan or owl: thus laden, the bee would make
for its nest in some lofty tree, and betray its store of sweets.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mitchell&#8217;s</span>

This disease made dreadful ravages among the natives
about the same time as the colony in New South Wales was settled.
&ldquo;The recollection of this scourge will long survive in the
traditionary songs of these simple people. The consternation which
it excited is yet as fresh in their minds, as if it had been an
occurrence of but yesterday, although the generation that witnessed
its horrors has almost passed away. The moment one of them was
seized with it, was the signal for abandoning him to his fate.
Brothers deserted their brothers, husbands their wives, wives their
husbands, children their parents, and parents their children; and
in some of the caves of the coast, heaps of decayed bones still
indicate the spots where these ignorant and helpless children of

The half-caste children are generally put to death by the

According to Captain Tench, who is quoted by the Roman
Catholic, Dr. Ullathorne, &ldquo;Divine service was performed at Sydney only
one Sunday in the month,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Rev. Mr. Johnson was the best farmer
in the country.&rdquo; What truth there may be in these insinuations, or in the
charge against Judge Burton of enlarging upon a Romish priest&#8217;s being a
convict, while he disguises the same truth when it applied to an English
clergyman, must be left to others better acquainted with the facts to
determine. See Ullathorne&#8217;s Reply to Burton, p. 5.</p></div>

Religion, of course, concerns all equally, only the
guilty and the wretched seem to be the last persons who can afford
to reject its consolations, even in this world. However, the conduct
of those in authority was pretty much on a par with that of the
convicts, and it was only when one of the earlier governors was
told of but five or six persons attending divine service, that
&ldquo;he determined to go to church himself, and stated that he expected
his example would be followed by the people.&rdquo; See Burton on Education
and Religion in New South Wales, p. 7.</p></div>

Whatever may be the improvement of the middling and upper
classes, <em>nationally speaking</em> the passion for strong liquor
continues to bear sway in the British islands to a deplorable extent.
Lord Ashley has stated in the House of Commons during the present
session, 1843, that there is good authority for estimating our annual
consumption of spirituous liquors at twenty-five millions sterling!
Compare the <em>gross</em> amount of the revenues of the English Church,
about four millions, and those of the <em>poor</em> Kirk of Scotland, the
<em>plundered</em> Church of Ireland, and the &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; efforts of
the hundred and one sects of Dissenters, together with those of the
Romish Church:&mdash;and what is the result? Probably, nearly three times as
much is spent in these islands upon spirituous liquors as the whole cost
of religious instruction of every kind amounts to!</p></div>

The crops of the first settlers were paid for by the
Government in spirits, but Captain Hunter endeavoured to put an end to
this practice, for it was not possible that a farmer who should be idle
enough to throw away the labour of twelve months, for the purchase of a
few gallons of injurious liquors, could expect to thrive, or enjoy those
comforts which sobriety and industry can alone procure.</p></div>

It may not be out of place to quote in support of this
opinion the sensible words of an Australian writer. &ldquo;I confess I like to
hear of high wages, and of good prices of provisions&mdash;of the productions
of the country,&mdash;for where they prevail for any length of time, the
country must be prosperous. Paradoxical as it may seem, it is no less
true, that the poorest country is always that where provisions are sold
at the cheapest rate. To the same purpose is the testimony of Sir G. Gipps,
the present Governor of New South Wales, appointed by Lord Melbourne in
1837, who says:&mdash;&lsquo;The total amount of the grain&rsquo; (imported) &lsquo;even at these
prices, amounted to the fearful sum of 246,000<em>l.</em>; but that, it must
be remembered, was only the prime cost in the countries where the wheat
was grown, and to that must be added the charges for freight, insurance,
and commission, probably as much more, so that in two years the colony
would expend upwards of half a million of money for foreign bread.
<em>The distress of the colony was owing to these immense
importations.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;See Speech of Governor Gipps in Council. Australian
and New Zealand Magazine, No. iii. p. 163. See also <span class="smcap">Ross&#8217;s</span>

About the time of Captain Hunter&#8217;s taking the reins of
government a cow was sold for 80<em>l.</em>, a horse cost 90<em>l.</em>, and
a Cape sheep 7<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> Other prices were in proportion;
fresh meat was very scarce, and the various attempts to import live stock
had been far from successful. Still a <em>beginning</em> had been made,
and it is astonishing how rapidly rural wealth began to multiply in
New South Wales, after the difficulties of the first eight or ten years
had been overcome.</p></div>

misery to the unhappy perpetrators, and to their wretched victims, but

providing for the support of as many clergymen, as the necessities of

At a time of great distress, when 270 additional inhabitants
had just made good their landing at Norfolk Island, whilst the ships and
provisions sent with them from Port Jackson were almost entirely lost,
these birds of providence, as they were justly called, furnished a supply
for the necessities of the people. Mount Pitt, the highest ground in the
island, was observed to be crowded with these birds during the night, for
in the day-time they go out to sea in search of food. They burrow in the
ground, and the hill was as full of holes as a rabbit-warren; in size
they were not bigger than pigeons, but they looked much larger in their
feathers. Their eggs were well tasted enough, and though the birds
themselves had a fishy flavour, hunger made them acceptable. They were
easily taken, for when small fires were kindled to attract their notice,
they would drop down faster than the people could seize them. For two
months together, it is said, that not less than from two to three thousand
of these birds were taken every night, so that it was with reason that
the starving population of Norfolk Island called them birds of providence.</p></div>

One of the vain attempts of the present age is that of
entirely preventing the various fluctuations to which, from accidents,
bad seasons, &amp;c., the price of bread is subject. It did appear as though
a certain average of moderate prices was established in England; but,
recently, the system has been again altered, and time must show how it
works. Certainly the changes in the value of corn in New South Wales
have formerly been violent enough, supposing the following statement to
be correct: &ldquo;I have nine years been a landholder in this colony, and
seven years have cultivated my own farm. In this time I have twice given
wheat to my pigs, because I did not know what else to do with it; twice
I have known wheat selling at fifteen shillings per bushel, and once at
twenty shillings!&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Atkinson</span> <em>on the Encouragement of

According to Mr. Montgomery Martin, (Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, p. 266,)
Cornwall and Buckinghamshire continue to be its only counties, and it is
subdivided into nine police districts; but Dr. Ross&#8217;s Almanac for 1836
contains, at p. 238, the governor&#8217;s proclamation for the division mentioned
above; whilst a third division of the island into the counties of Argyle and
Launceston is followed in the Report of the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel, for 1842. The above may serve for a specimen of the obscurity
and confusion upon these trifling matters, respecting which accuracy
seems almost unattainable.</p></div>

The following specimen of the evil art of stirring up
the discontent of those that are suffering under the dispensations of
Providence, is taken from an old newspaper, published in Hobart Town
in 1835. It may be stated, that in the very same paper we are informed
that the drought had recently been so great that scarcely a cabbage,
or any other vegetable but potato, was to be obtained in the town. Of
course water was scarce, and precautions had been taken by the Governor
to preserve some at a place whence the shipping were supplied; but this
careful conduct of their ruler is thus held up to the abhorrence of the
people. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; it is asked, &ldquo;do not the people drink the ditchwater and
be poisoned quietly; it is quite enough that their betters should enjoy
such a luxury as pure water.&rdquo; And how often in England do we see this
sort of trash printed by those <em>dealers in knowledge</em>, the
newspaper-writers, who sometimes argue as though all the credit of
prosperous occurrences belonged to the <em>people</em> of a country, and
all the disgrace and responsibility of misfortunes and trials were to be
put off upon its <em>rulers</em>! How often are we reminded of the Israelites
murmuring against Moses on account of the miseries of that
wilderness in which their own sins condemned them to wander!</p></div>

St. Giles&#8217;s and Trinity, are likely to be erected in Hobart Town. See

In these matters it is impossible to get at truth. Each man
judges upon certain data, but though the conclusion of each may be correct,
yet because the data were partial and imperfect, so likewise will the
conclusions be. Mr. Mann, who was examined by the Committee upon South
Australia, gives it as his opinion that about four-fifths of the land in
that colony were bad. However, he had never been more than three weeks in
it nor above fourteen miles from its chief town, so his judgment was
formed principally upon hearsay. Others, probably, have gone into the
contrary extreme of praising the soil too highly, and truth may, as usual,
lie between the two extremes.</p></div>

from <em>Christian</em> England to found a colony; having on board upwards
of 500 souls, but unprovided with any minister of religion! How strange

A glance over the two ponderous volumes of the evidence
before the Transportation Committee in 1837 and 1838 will satisfy every
unprejudiced person that our penal colonies are not yet ripe for a
representative government. It is curious enough to compare the fearful
picture of these settlements drawn by one section of the so-called Liberal
party, which wages war against transportation, with the more pleasing and
flattering description of their social condition which is given by that
other section of the same party which claims for the colonists
&ldquo;constitutional rights.&rdquo;</p></div>

They are accused of spending 20,000<em>l.</em> a-year of public
money, under pretence of providing for religious instruction and education,
while nothing was really done; whereas, out of this sum, nearly
17,000<em>l.</em> were already appropriated for the existing ecclesiastical
establishment; and, during the continuance of the Corporation, the schools
increased from 16 to 40, and the number of children educated in them from
1,037 to 2,426. See Burton on Religion and Education in New South

The following striking testimony in favour of the
<em>system</em> of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts comes from a quarter by no means unduly biassed in its
favour. &ldquo;How have thousands and tens of thousands been raised in
Scotland, for the last forty years, to fit out and to maintain beyond
seas whomsoever the dissenting ministers of London chose to ordain as
missionaries to the heathen? God forbid, that I should ever whisper a
syllable against missions to the heathen! But I have seen too many
missionaries, not to have seen more than I choose to mention, whom men
possessed of the least discernment would never have presumed to send
forth on such an errand! <em>The colonies, however, were the first field
to be occupied; and if that field had been properly occupied, it would
have afforded much assistance to missions to the
heathen.</em>&ldquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lang&#8217;s</span>

&ldquo;Catholic,&rdquo; a most honoured term in ancient times, has in
modern days been very unfortunate. Even now the Romanists misuse it for
&ldquo;Papistical,&rdquo; the Dissenters occasionally use it to signify
&ldquo;Latitudinarian,&rdquo; and the members of the Church of England are either
afraid to use it at all, or else are perpetually harping upon it, as

It is right to state here that the cause of a supply of
religious instruction having been so long delayed in Norfolk Island
is said, by a Roman Catholic writer, to have been the impossibility of
finding a clergyman to undertake the charge. See Ullathorne&#8217;s Reply to
Burton, pp. 39, 40. Supposing this account to be correct then,
undoubtedly, the English Church must share the blame of neglecting
Norfolk Island along with the government, and it is not the wish of the
writer of these pages to deny the applicability of the prophet&#8217;s
confession to ourselves: &ldquo;O God, to us belongeth confusion of face,
to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have
sinned against Thee.&rdquo; (Dan. ix. 8.) Still, even according to
Dr. Ullathorne, the penal settlement was established six years before
its religious instruction was thought of by the government.</p></div>

Evidence of J. MacArthur, Esq., before the Committee on
Transportation, in 1837, No. 3371-2, p. 220. The richest man in the
colony, an emancipist, was said, in 1837, to be worth 40,000<em>l.</em> or
45,000<em>l.</em> a year. For an account of the shameless roguery, and
drunken folly, by means of which so vast an income was amassed, see
Report of Transp. Com. 1837, p. 14 and 104.</p></div>

For the mode in which the law admitting emancipists into
the jurors&#8217; box was passed, see Lang&#8217;s New South Wales, vol. i.
p. 317-320. &ldquo;Two absent members of the Legislative Council were known
to be opposed to it. Of those present, the governor (Bourke) and five
others were in favour of it, while six were against it. The governor
gave a second and casting vote.&rdquo;</p></div>

See Report of Transportation Committee, 1838, p. 31.
&ldquo;A large proportion of the persons who have appeared and served,&rdquo; as
jurors, &ldquo;are publicans,&rdquo; to whose houses prosecutors, parties on bail,
or witnesses, resort, for the purpose of drinking, while in attendance
upon the court. Once, when a jury was locked up all night, much foul
and disgusting language was used; and to gain a release from this
association, the disputed point was yielded; &ldquo;no greater punishment can
be inflicted upon a respectable person than to be shut up with such
people for a few hours, or for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See Burton&#8217;s Letter, Appendix to Transportation Committee&#8217;s Report,
1837, p. 301-2. Dr. Lang&#8217;s book on New South Wales abounds in wretched
puns, but one rather favourable specimen may be given,
when, in allusion to the Englishman&#8217;s right of being tried by his
peers, the Doctor styles the jurors above described
&ldquo;<em>the Colonial Peerage!</em>&rdquo;</p></div>

beyond this, is established in most of the Australian colonies. The

the interim, been supplied.</p></div>
